You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

CVE_NAME: CVE-2024-58007

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number
 commit 22cf4fae6660b6e1a583a41cbf84e3046ca9ccd0 upstream.
 
 On MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does
 not change across individual devices. It's always:
 
   db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number
   2644893864
 
 The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not
 have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an
 existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's
 not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make
 sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing
 with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916
 devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo
 struct in SMEM.
 
 Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the
 field is also taken into account.
