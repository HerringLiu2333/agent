You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually).
4. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs). If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".
5. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
6. Please try to use the simplest way and fewer steps to achieve your goal. But for every step, your response should be as concrete as possible so that I can easily follow your guidance and write a correct checker!

CVE_NAME: CVE-2024-58014

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 wifi: brcmsmac: add gain range check to wlc_phy_iqcal_gainparams_nphy()
 [ Upstream commit 3f4a0948c3524ae50f166dbc6572a3296b014e62 ]
 
 In 'wlc_phy_iqcal_gainparams_nphy()', add gain range check to WARN()
 instead of possible out-of-bounds 'tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy' access.
 Compile tested only.

 Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58014

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds array access (read) due to missing bounds validation

3. Root Cause Summary
The function wlc_phy_iqcal_gainparams_nphy() computed an index k for a calibration table and then immediately indexed tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy[band_idx][k][...] without verifying that k was within the valid range. If k equaled the sentinel/upper bound NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS, the subsequent accesses read past the end of the table. The patch adds a bounds check with WARN_ON and an early return to prevent the out-of-bounds access.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- Broadcom brcmsmac wireless driver, N-PHY calibration (drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmsmac/phy/phy_n.c).

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- After a switch/break determining k, the code used k to index the gain-parameter table:
  - params->txgm = tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy[band_idx][k][1];
  - params->pga  = tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy[band_idx][k][2];
  - params->pad  = tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy[band_idx][k][3];
- There was no check ensuring k < NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS, so k equal to NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS led to an out-of-bounds read.

3) Trigger Condition:
- When the earlier logic leaves k at NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS (likely indicating no valid gain entry found). The exact control-flow conditions that produce this value are not included in the provided diff and are therefore Unknown/Not determinable.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Out-of-bounds read from tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy can fetch memory beyond the table, potentially causing a kernel crash (e.g., page fault/KASAN report) or propagating invalid calibration parameters into subsequent PHY programming, leading to instability. Information disclosure potential is Unknown/Not determinable.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Defensive validation: add a boundary check for k against NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS and abort the operation if violated, logging via WARN_ON.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Inserted immediately before the table dereferences:
  - if (WARN_ON(k == NPHY_IQCAL_NUMGAINS))
    return;
- This prevents indexing tbl_iqcal_gainparams_nphy[band_idx][k][...] when k is out of range.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The change is purely a local bounds check without altering locking, RCU usage, or ordering.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Table-driven calibration logic is common in wireless drivers; missing bounds checks on computed indices can lead to similar OOB reads. Proactive validation of indices and sentinel values should be enforced across such code paths. While this instance is a read, such bugs can still cause denial-of-service and complicate debugging; comprehensive static analysis and targeted audits of calibration/lookup tables are advisable.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals).
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals}
