You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually).
4. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs). If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".
5. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
6. Please try to use the simplest way and fewer steps to achieve your goal. But for every step, your response should be as concrete as possible so that I can easily follow your guidance and write a correct checker!

    tracing/osnoise: Fix crash in timerlat_dump_stack()
    We have observed kernel panics when using timerlat with stack saving,
    with the following dmesg output:
    
    memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 88 byte write of buffer size 0

    __timerlat_dump_stack() constructs the ftrace stack entry like this:
    
    struct stack_entry *entry;
    ...
    memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size);
    entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;
    
    Since commit e7186af7fb26 ("tracing: Add back FORTIFY_SOURCE logic to
    kernel_stack event structure"), struct stack_entry marks its caller
    field with __counted_by(size). At the time of the memcpy, entry->size
    contains garbage from the ringbuffer, which under some circumstances is
    zero, triggering a kernel panic by buffer overflow.
    
    Populate the size field before the memcpy so that the out-of-bounds
    check knows the correct size. This is analogous to
    __ftrace_trace_stack().

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38493

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds write / unsafe memcpy due to uninitialized counted-by length field, resulting in kernel crash (DoS)

3. Root Cause Summary
The function __timerlat_dump_stack() performed memcpy into struct stack_entry->caller, which is annotated with __counted_by(size), before initializing entry->size. Because entry->size contained uninitialized data from the ring buffer (often zero), the FORTIFY_SOURCE bounds check interpreted the destination buffer length as 0 and triggered a kernel panic. The flawed logic was the incorrect initialization order: “memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size); entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;” should have set entry->size before the memcpy. This is analogous to __ftrace_trace_stack(), which initializes the counted length prior to copying.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
tracing/osnoise (timerlat stack saving path)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In __timerlat_dump_stack(), entry->size (the length driving __counted_by for entry->caller) was set after the memcpy, leaving FORTIFY to see a zero/garbage size during the copy and flag the write as out-of-bounds.

3) Trigger Condition:
Using timerlat with stack saving and reading from the timerlat fd (timerlat_fd_read path) when ring_buffer_event_data() returns an entry whose size field is still uninitialized at the time of memcpy; FORTIFY then computes the destination size as 0 while “size” > 0.

4) Impact Mechanism:
FORTIFY’s destination-bound check detects “88 byte write of buffer size 0” and calls __fortify_panic, causing a kernel WARN/panic (DoS). Without the check, the memcpy would write past the actual caller array bounds determined by nr_entries, risking memory corruption.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Initialize the counted-by length (entry->size) before performing the memcpy so the FORTIFY bounds check uses the correct destination size.

2) Key Code Changes:
In __timerlat_dump_stack():
- Pre-patch order:
  memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size);
  entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;
- Post-patch order:
  entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;
  memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size);
This reordering ensures entry->size is set prior to the copy.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No changes to locking or concurrency. The existing trace_buffer_lock_reserve() and trace_buffer_unlock_commit_nostack() usage remains unchanged; the fix strictly adjusts assignment order within the reserved event.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This highlights the need to initialize __counted_by fields before any memory operations that rely on them, especially under FORTIFY_SOURCE. Similar patterns in tracing or other subsystems can lead to crashes or memory corruption if initialization order is wrong. Ensuring correct field initialization and copy ordering improves robustness against DoS and latent buffer overflows in kernel instrumentation paths.
