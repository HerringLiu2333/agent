You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], and [FUNCTION_CONTENT].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    tracing/osnoise: Fix crash in timerlat_dump_stack()
    We have observed kernel panics when using timerlat with stack saving,
    with the following dmesg output:
    
    memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 88 byte write of buffer size 0
    WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 8153 at lib/string_helpers.c:1032 __fortify_report+0x55/0xa0

    __timerlat_dump_stack() constructs the ftrace stack entry like this:
    
    struct stack_entry *entry;
    ...
    memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size);
    entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;
    
    Since commit e7186af7fb26 ("tracing: Add back FORTIFY_SOURCE logic to
    kernel_stack event structure"), struct stack_entry marks its caller
    field with __counted_by(size). At the time of the memcpy, entry->size
    contains garbage from the ringbuffer, which under some circumstances is
    zero, triggering a kernel panic by buffer overflow.
    
    Populate the size field before the memcpy so that the out-of-bounds
    check knows the correct size. This is analogous to
    __ftrace_trace_stack().
