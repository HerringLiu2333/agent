You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually).
4. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs). If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".
5. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
6. Please try to use the simplest way and fewer steps to achieve your goal. But for every step, your response should be as concrete as possible so that I can easily follow your guidance and write a correct checker!

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 clk: mmp: pxa1908-apbc: Fix NULL vs IS_ERR() check
 The devm_kzalloc() function returns NULL on error, not error pointers.
 Fix the check.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58065

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to improper error handling (misuse of IS_ERR/PTR_ERR with a NULL-returning allocator)

3. Root Cause Summary
The probe routine pxa1908_apbc_probe() treated the result of devm_kzalloc() as if it could be an ERR_PTR and checked it with IS_ERR(). Since devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on failure, the IS_ERR() check never triggered on allocation failure. The code then proceeded to use the NULL pointer (pxa_unit), leading to a NULL pointer dereference during device probe. The patch replaces the erroneous IS_ERR/PTR_ERR logic with a correct NULL check and returns -ENOMEM, preventing dereference of a NULL allocation result.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock framework (drivers/clk), Marvell MMP PXA1908 APBC driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-apbc.c), function pxa1908_apbc_probe().

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
After allocating pxa_unit with devm_kzalloc(), the code did:
“if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
This is incorrect for devm_kzalloc(), which returns NULL on failure, not ERR_PTRs, so allocation failure was not detected.

3) Trigger Condition:
devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL) returning NULL (e.g., due to memory pressure or fault injection) during the device probe path.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Subsequent use of pxa_unit when it is NULL causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops/panic during probe and a denial of service. Additionally, the error path would not properly report -ENOMEM, impairing correct error propagation.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Correct the error handling to match devm_kzalloc() semantics by checking for NULL and returning -ENOMEM on failure, preventing use of a NULL pointer.

2) Key Code Changes:
In pxa1908_apbc_probe():
- Replaced:
  “if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
- With:
  “if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;”
This directly aligns the check with devm_kzalloc()’s NULL-on-error contract.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is confined to allocation failure handling and does not alter locking, ordering, or concurrency behavior.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix prevents a crash-only class issue that can be triggered on allocation failure in the probe path, improving kernel robustness against low-memory conditions or fault-injection scenarios. Similar misuse patterns (IS_ERR() on kmalloc/devm_kzalloc results) can exist in other drivers and should be audited. While this bug is unlikely to enable privilege escalation, it facilitates denial-of-service by crashing the kernel during device initialization if allocation fails. Properly returning -ENOMEM also ensures accurate error reporting to the driver core and avoids ambiguous success paths on failure.

Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals).
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
