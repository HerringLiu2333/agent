You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

CVE_NAME: CVE-2024-58094

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 jfs: add check read-only before truncation in jfs_truncate_nolock()
 [ Upstream commit b5799dd77054c1ec49b0088b006c9908e256843b ]
 
 Added a check for "read-only" mode in the `jfs_truncate_nolock`
 function to avoid errors related to writing to a read-only
 filesystem.
 
 Call stack:
 
 block_write_begin() {
   jfs_write_failed() {
     jfs_truncate() {
       jfs_truncate_nolock() {
         txEnd() {
           ...
           log = JFS_SBI(tblk->sb)->log;
           // (log == NULL)
 
 If the `isReadOnly(ip)` condition is triggered in
 `jfs_truncate_nolock`, the function execution will stop, and no
 further data modification will occur. Instead, the `xtTruncate`
 function will be called with the "COMMIT_WMAP" flag, preventing
 modifications in "read-only" mode.

 Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")
