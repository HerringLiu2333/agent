You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 wifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()
 During rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles(), there is a normalizing process
 which will re-order the list if an entry with target pattern is found.
 And once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But,
 `break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry
 still continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target
 pattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be
 soft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.

 Fix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.

 The following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.
