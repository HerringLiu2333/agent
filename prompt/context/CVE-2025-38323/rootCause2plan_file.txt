You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

<MISSING prompt_file.txt in /home/bigniu/project/agent/res/CVE-2025-38323>

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
2) Step 2: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
...
(narrow to ≤12 steps)

3. Target Elements
- {list of element types to inspect}

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- {conceptual taint/flow rules to track}

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: {brief}
- Negative: {brief}
- Test harness notes: {brief}

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
{low/medium/high}

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- {list}

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- {explicit missing info or assumptions}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not emit any CodeQL, SQL, pseudocode, or query fragments.
- Keep answers evidence-based and reference which provided field supported each major choice (e.g., “based on [PATCH_DIFF] hunk that adds X”).
- Output must be machine-parseable: keep the exact numbered section headings as above.
