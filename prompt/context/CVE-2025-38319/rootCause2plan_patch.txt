You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    drm/amd/pp: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table
    The function atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table() and
    atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table_v2_2() does not check the return
    value of smu_atom_get_data_table(). If smu_atom_get_data_table()
    fails to retrieve vram_info, it returns NULL which is later
    dereferenced.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38319

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference (missing return-value validation)

3. Root Cause Summary
The functions atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table() and atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table_v2_2() assign vram_info from smu_atom_get_data_table() but do not check for a NULL return. They immediately dereference vram_info (e.g., vram_info->ucNumOfVRAMModule) for bounds checking, causing a NULL pointer dereference if the data table retrieval fails. The patch adds a NULL check and early return, preventing the unsafe dereference.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
DRM AMD PowerPlay (drm/amd/pp), memory controller register initialization paths: atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table() and atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table_v2_2().

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- Missing validation of smu_atom_get_data_table() return value when fetching the VRAM_Info table.
- Immediate dereference of vram_info (e.g., "if (module_index >= vram_info->ucNumOfVRAMModule)") without verifying non-NULL.

3) Trigger Condition:
smu_atom_get_data_table(hwmgr->adev, GetIndexIntoMasterTable(DATA, VRAM_Info), &size, &frev, &crev) returns NULL (failure to retrieve the VRAM_Info table).

4) Impact Mechanism:
Dereferencing the NULL vram_info pointer leads to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops/panic and denial of service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add a NULL-pointer check on vram_info immediately after the smu_atom_get_data_table() call and return -EINVAL with an error log if retrieval fails.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table():
  Added:
  "if (!vram_info) { pr_err('Could not retrieve the VramInfo table!'); return -EINVAL; }"
- In atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table_v2_2():
  Added the same NULL check and early return after assigning vram_info.
These changes prevent subsequent dereferences (e.g., accessing ucNumOfVRAMModule) when vram_info is NULL.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch introduces input validation only; no changes to locking, RCU, or ordering.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Validating firmware/BIOS-derived tables is critical across GPU driver paths; similar unchecked returns from smu_atom_get_data_table() may cause systemic stability issues.
- Early error handling reduces kernel crash surfaces and improves resilience against malformed or missing hardware tables.
- Although primarily a stability/DoS issue, consistent defensive checks help maintain robust boundaries against untrusted or unreliable hardware data sources.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.
