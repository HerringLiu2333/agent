You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()
 [ Upstream commit 3df7546fc03b8f004eee0b9e3256369f7d096685 ]
 
 syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),
 for one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fix
 this warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,
 for practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the
 "too small to fail" memory-allocation rule applies.

 One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such
 request will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately
 returning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.
 There is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.
