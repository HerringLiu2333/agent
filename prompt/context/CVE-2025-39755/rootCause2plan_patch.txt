You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

CVE_NAME: CVE-2025-39755

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    staging: gpib: Fix cb7210 pcmcia Oops
    The  pcmcia_driver struct was still only using the old .name
    initialization in the drv field. This led to a NULL pointer
    deref Oops in strcmp called from pcmcia_register_driver.
    
    Initialize the pcmcia_driver struct name field.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-39755

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference (kernel Oops / denial-of-service)

3. Root Cause Summary
The cb_gpib_cs PCMCIA driver initialized the driver name using an obsolete nested field (.drv = { .name = "cb_gpib_cs", }) instead of the current top-level .name field in struct pcmcia_driver. As a result, the actual pcmcia_driver.name remained NULL. When pcmcia_register_driver() executed, it called strcmp() on the NULL name, causing a NULL pointer dereference and an Oops.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Staging drivers: gpib (cb7210) PCMCIA driver; PCMCIA core registration path.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Incorrect struct initialization: the cb_gpib_cs_driver used the deprecated .drv.name initializer and did not set the pcmcia_driver.name field, leaving it NULL.

3) Trigger Condition:
Loading/registering the driver (e.g., via module insertion) triggers pcmcia_register_driver(), which performs strcmp() on driver->name.

4) Impact Mechanism:
strcmp() dereferences a NULL pointer (driver->name == NULL) inside pcmcia_register_driver(), leading to a kernel Oops and potential system crash/DoS.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Update the struct initialization to align with the current API by setting the top-level .name field directly, ensuring it is non-NULL.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added: .name = "cb_gpib_cs",
- Removed: .drv = { .name = "cb_gpib_cs", }
This change ensures pcmcia_driver.name is correctly populated.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes; the fix is limited to structure initialization and eliminates a NULL dereference during driver registration.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
API evolution in core subsystems (like PCMCIA) can turn stale structure initializations into crash vectors if fields are left NULL. Similar misinitializations in other drivers may cause Oops during registration paths, enabling trivial local DoS via modprobe. Auditing drivers for deprecated field usage (.drv.name) and ensuring current field initialization (.name) is set is important to prevent systemic reliability issues.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
2) Step 2: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
...
(narrow to ≤12 steps)

3. Target Elements
- {list of element types to inspect}

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- {conceptual taint/flow rules to track}

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: {brief}
- Negative: {brief}
- Test harness notes: {brief}

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
{low/medium/high}

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- {list}

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- {explicit missing info or assumptions}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not emit any CodeQL, SQL, pseudocode, or query fragments.
- Keep answers evidence-based and reference which provided field supported each major choice (e.g., “based on [PATCH_DIFF] hunk that adds X”).
- Output must be machine-parseable: keep the exact numbered section headings as above.
