You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

CVE_NAME: CVE-2025-39755

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    staging: gpib: Fix cb7210 pcmcia Oops
    The  pcmcia_driver struct was still only using the old .name
    initialization in the drv field. This led to a NULL pointer
    deref Oops in strcmp called from pcmcia_register_driver.
    
    Initialize the pcmcia_driver struct name field.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-39755

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to missing/incorrect initialization (API misuse)

3. Root Cause Summary
The driver’s pcmcia_driver struct did not initialize the required top-level name field and instead set the deprecated nested drv.name field. pcmcia_register_driver expects pcmcia_driver.name and calls strcmp on it; since name was NULL, this resulted in a NULL pointer dereference during driver registration. The patch corrects this by initializing pcmcia_driver.name and removing the incorrect drv.name assignment.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Staging drivers (gpib/cb7210) on the PCMCIA bus; registration via pcmcia_register_driver.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In static struct pcmcia_driver cb_gpib_cs_driver, the code used “.drv = { .name = "cb_gpib_cs", }” and did not set the top-level “.name” field, leaving pcmcia_driver.name NULL (see FUNCTION_CONTENT and PATCH_DIFF).

3) Trigger Condition:
When the driver is registered (module load or device insertion), pcmcia_register_driver invokes strcmp using pcmcia_driver.name, leading to strcmp(NULL, ...) and an Oops.

4) Impact Mechanism:
strcmp dereferences the NULL name pointer, causing a kernel Oops and system crash/denial of service during registration of the cb_gpib_cs_driver.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Align with the current PCMCIA driver API by initializing the pcmcia_driver.name field and removing the outdated drv.name usage.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added initialization: “.name = "cb_gpib_cs",” in static struct pcmcia_driver cb_gpib_cs_driver.
- Removed deprecated assignment: “.drv = { .name = "cb_gpib_cs", },” (PATCH_DIFF hunk shows the replacement).

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is limited to structure initialization; no locking or ordering modifications were introduced.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Correct initialization of driver metadata prevents registration-time crashes, reducing denial-of-service risk triggered by device plug-in or module load. This highlights the importance of updating drivers to match evolving kernel APIs, suggesting audits of other drivers (especially in staging) for similar field-initialization mismatches to avoid systemic stability and security issues.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
2) Step 2: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not emit any CodeQL, SQL, pseudocode, or query fragments.
- Keep answers evidence-based and reference which provided field supported each major choice (e.g., “based on [PATCH_DIFF] hunk that adds X”).
- Output must be machine-parseable: keep the exact numbered section headings as above.
