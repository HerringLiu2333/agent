You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 iio: adc: ti-ads1298: Add NULL check in ads1298_init
 devm_kasprintf() can return a NULL pointer on failure. A check on the
 return value of such a call in ads1298_init() is missing. Add it.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57944

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to missing allocation failure check

3. Root Cause Summary
In drivers/iio/adc/ti-ads1298.c, function ads1298_init() assigned the result of devm_kasprintf() to indio_dev->name without checking for NULL. Since devm_kasprintf() can return NULL on allocation failure, indio_dev->name could become NULL and later be dereferenced by the IIO core or driver code, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference. The patch adds the missing NULL check and returns -ENOMEM when allocation fails, preventing subsequent use of a NULL name pointer.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem, ADC driver ti-ads1298

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
ads1298_init() unconditionally set indio_dev->name = devm_kasprintf(...); without verifying the return value, allowing indio_dev->name to be NULL on allocation failure.

3) Trigger Condition:
Low-memory or allocation failure during device initialization when devm_kasprintf(dev, GFP_KERNEL, "ads129%u%s", indio_dev->num_channels, suffix) returns NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
A NULL indio_dev->name may be dereferenced later during device registration or operation in the IIO core/driver paths, causing a kernel crash (OOPS) due to NULL pointer dereference.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add an explicit NULL check immediately after devm_kasprintf() and propagate an -ENOMEM error if allocation fails.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In ads1298_init(), after:
  indio_dev->name = devm_kasprintf(dev, GFP_KERNEL, "ads129%u%s", indio_dev->num_channels, suffix);
  the patch adds:
  if (!indio_dev->name)
    return -ENOMEM;

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is a straightforward error-path check with no locking or ordering modifications.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Unchecked returns from allocation helpers like devm_kasprintf() can lead to widespread NULL dereference issues in probe/init paths across drivers. Ensuring consistent NULL checks prevents kernel crashes under memory pressure and improves robustness of device initialization flows.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).

- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
