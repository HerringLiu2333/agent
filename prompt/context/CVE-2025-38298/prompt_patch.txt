You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    EDAC/skx_common: Fix general protection fault
    After loading i10nm_edac (which automatically loads skx_edac_common), if
    unload only i10nm_edac, then reload it and perform error injection testing,
    a general protection fault may occur:
    
      mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check events logged
      Oops: general protection fault ...
      ...
      Workqueue: events mce_gen_pool_process

      skx_mce_check_error+0x17/0x20 [skx_edac_common]
      ...
    
    The issue arose was because the variable 'adxl_component_count' (inside
    skx_edac_common), which counts the ADXL components, was not reset. During
    the reloading of i10nm_edac, the count was incremented by the actual number
    of ADXL components again, resulting in a count that was double the real
    number of ADXL components. This led to an out-of-bounds reference to the
    ADXL component array, causing the general protection fault above.
    
    Fix this issue by resetting the 'adxl_component_count' in adxl_put(),
    which is called during the unloading of {skx,i10nm}_edac.
