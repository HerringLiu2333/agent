You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually).
4. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs). If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".
5. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
6. Please try to use the simplest way and fewer steps to achieve your goal. But for every step, your response should be as concrete as possible so that I can easily follow your guidance and write a correct checker!

CVE_NAME: CVE-2024-58082

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 media: nuvoton: Fix an error check in npcm_video_ece_init()
 When function of_find_device_by_node() fails, it returns NULL instead of
 an error code. So the corresponding error check logic should be modified
 to check whether the return value is NULL and set the error code to be
 returned as -ENODEV.
 
 Fixes: 46c15a4ff1f4 ("media: nuvoton: Add driver for NPCM video capture and encoding engine")

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58082

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect error handling (pointer misuse)

3. Root Cause Summary
The function npcm_video_ece_init() incorrectly assumed of_find_device_by_node() returns an ERR_PTR on failure and used IS_ERR/PTR_ERR to handle errors. In reality, of_find_device_by_node() returns NULL on failure. Because the code did not check for NULL, a NULL ece_pdev was later dereferenced (e.g., in devm_platform_ioremap_resource(ece_pdev, 0)), causing a kernel crash.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Linux media subsystem, Nuvoton NPCM video capture and encoding engine driver (drivers/media/platform/nuvoton/npcm-video.c).

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In npcm_video_ece_init(), the pre-patch code used "if (IS_ERR(ece_pdev))" after calling of_find_device_by_node(ece_node). Since that API returns NULL on failure (not ERR_PTR), the error path was never taken, and subsequent code used ece_pdev without validating it was non-NULL.

3) Trigger Condition:
An ECE device node exists and is marked available (of_device_is_available(ece_node) true), but of_find_device_by_node(ece_node) fails and returns NULL (e.g., the platform device is not registered/bound yet or missing).

4) Impact Mechanism:
The function proceeds with a NULL ece_pdev and dereferences it in devm_platform_ioremap_resource(ece_pdev, 0) and later accesses ece_pdev->dev for reset control, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash (denial of service).

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Adjust the error handling to detect NULL return values from of_find_device_by_node() and return a proper error code (-ENODEV) instead of attempting PTR_ERR().

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replace "if (IS_ERR(ece_pdev))" with "if (!ece_pdev)" to correctly detect failure.
- Replace "return PTR_ERR(ece_pdev);" with "return -ENODEV;" to return a meaningful error when the device is not found.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch only corrects error-path logic and does not alter locking, ordering, or concurrency mechanisms.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Correctly handling NULL vs. ERR_PTR returns from OF and device discovery APIs prevents common crash paths in drivers, especially during probe sequences or with incomplete/misalconfigured device trees. This fix reduces the risk of denial-of-service conditions caused by improper error checks and reinforces the need for consistent API usage patterns in kernel drivers. Auditing similar error-handling patterns across drivers can prevent comparable vulnerabilities.
