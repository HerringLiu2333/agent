You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], and [FUNCTION_CONTENT].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 drm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyed
 commit 21f1435b1e6b012a07c42f36b206d2b66fc8f13b upstream.
 
 If the active performance monitor (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is being
 destroyed, stop it first. Currently, the active perfmon is not
 stopped during destruction, leaving the `v3d->active_perfmon` pointer
 stale. This can lead to undefined behavior and instability.

 This patch ensures that the active perfmon is stopped before being
 destroyed, aligning with the behavior introduced in commit
 7d1fd3638ee3 ("drm/v3d: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed").

 Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v5.15+
