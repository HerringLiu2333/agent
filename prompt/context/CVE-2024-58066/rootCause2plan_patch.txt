You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
 clk: mmp: pxa1908-apbcp: Fix a NULL vs IS_ERR() check
 The devm_kzalloc() function doesn't return error pointers, it returns
 NULL on error.  Update the check to match.
 
 Fixes: a89233dbd4df ("clk: mmp: Add Marvell PXA1908 APBCP driver")

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58066

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect error handling

3. Root Cause Summary
The probe function used IS_ERR()/PTR_ERR() to validate the result of devm_kzalloc(), but devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on failure, not error pointers. Because IS_ERR(NULL) evaluates false, the code continued execution with pxa_unit == NULL and dereferenced it, causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference. The patch replaces the incorrect IS_ERR/PTR_ERR handling with a proper NULL check returning -ENOMEM.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock subsystem, Marvell MMP PXA1908 APBCP driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-apbcp.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In pxa1908_apbcp_probe(), after allocating pxa_unit with devm_kzalloc(), the code checked:
“if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
This mismatched check failed to catch allocation failure (NULL), allowing subsequent dereference of pxa_unit.

3) Trigger Condition:
Allocation failure in devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL) yielding NULL (e.g., under memory pressure during device probe).

4) Impact Mechanism:
With pxa_unit == NULL, the next line “pxa_unit->base = devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);” dereferences NULL, leading to a kernel oops/panic and denial of service during device initialization.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Correct the failure check for devm_kzalloc() by testing for NULL and returning -ENOMEM, preventing use of a NULL pointer.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replaced:
  “if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
  with:
  “if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;”
No other logic changes; subsequent IS_ERR() check remains for pxa_unit->base, which may return an ERR_PTR from devm_platform_ioremap_resource().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is confined to error handling in the probe path; no locks or concurrency mechanisms were added or modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Correct error-handling patterns for devm_* allocation APIs are critical to avoid NULL dereferences that can crash the kernel, especially during device probing at boot or module insertion. This fix prevents a straightforward denial-of-service condition under memory pressure and reinforces consistent use of NULL checks versus IS_ERR() depending on API semantics. Ensuring accurate failure detection improves kernel robustness and reduces the attack surface of driver initialization paths.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
