You are a senior Linux kernel vulnerability analyst.
Task: Produce a structured root-cause analysis of the vulnerability that existed BEFORE the patch, strictly following the [OUTPUT FORMAT] below.

Rules:
1. Follow the [OUTPUT FORMAT] exactly and populate every field. Use evidence from [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].
2. Root cause = the flawed or missing pre-patch logic that the patch corrects (e.g., missing validation, incorrect locking/ordering, race window, unsafe access, integer/length misuse, lifetime/refcount bug, pointer misuse).
3. Be evidence-driven: reference function names, local context, and hunk scope in the diff; you may quote 1–3 lines of original (pre-patch) code only when necessary to support claims; avoid long code dumps.
4. Patch analysis must map each fix to the identified root cause (e.g., added checks, lock adjustments, lifetime/RCU changes, bounds fixes, condition rewrites).
5. Concurrency/locking: when relevant, explicitly state missing/incorrect locks, RCU usage, atomicity, or ordering and what the patch changed (lock/unlock points, ordering changes).
6. Memory/safety: when relevant, specify trigger conditions and impact (UAF, OOB, double free, uninitialized use, integer overflow/underflow, length miscalculation, TOCTOU, etc.).
7. Use only the provided materials ([PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). Do not speculate; when uncertain, state “Unknown/Not determinable”.
8. Keep it concise and technical: 3–8 clear sentences or bullet points per subsection.
9. Output nothing beyond the [OUTPUT FORMAT]; no extra headers, prefaces, or trailing notes.
10. If the root cause cannot be identified, state “Unknown/Not determinable” in the relevant subsection, but complete the remaining sections using available evidence.

CVE_NAME: CVE-2025-40114

[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    iio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms
    The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by
    veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7,
    which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.
    
    Coverity Issue
    CID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)
    overrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte
    elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using
    index int_index (which evaluates to 7)
    
    This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have
    but not necessary to backport.
