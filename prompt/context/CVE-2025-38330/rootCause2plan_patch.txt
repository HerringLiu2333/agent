You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

CVE_NAME: CVE-2025-38330

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)
    KASAN reported out of bounds access - cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets().
    The code uses mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes) for register value
    allocations. But later, this length is set to 8 bytes which causes
    test code failures.
    
    As fix, just remove the lenght override, keeping the original value 4
    for all operations.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38330

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds memory read due to length-field mismatch

3. Root Cause Summary
In the KUnit test function cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets, the coefficient descriptor’s length_bytes was overridden to 8 bytes while allocations were performed based on mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes). This mismatch caused subsequent test code to read 8 bytes from buffers sized for 4 bytes, producing an OOB read flagged by KASAN. The patch removes the erroneous override to keep the length consistent with allocation sizes.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
firmware: cs_dsp (KUnit test code for control cache)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
The test sets def.length_bytes = 8, diverging from the 4-byte size used for register value allocations derived from mock_coeff_template.length_bytes. No reallocation or validation accompanies the increase, leaving accessors to use 8-byte operations against 4-byte buffers.

3) Trigger Condition:
Running cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets with the overridden length while constructing controls and accessing their register values. KASAN detects an OOB read when the test attempts to process 8 bytes from buffers allocated for 4 bytes.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Read operations go past the end of the allocated 4-byte buffer due to the 8-byte length assumption, resulting in out-of-bounds memory reads and KASAN reports; in test context, this can cause failures or potential data exposure from adjacent memory.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Maintain consistent length by removing the override so that length_bytes stays at the original 4 bytes for both allocation and subsequent access.

2) Key Code Changes:
Deleted the line “def.length_bytes = 8;” within cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets; no other logic was altered.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None; the change is a size-field correction in a KUnit test path with no locking or concurrency implications.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This patch eliminates a false-positive KASAN OOB read caused by the test itself, improving test reliability and accuracy of memory-safety diagnostics. It underscores the need for strict consistency between descriptor length fields and the sizes used for allocations in cs_dsp-related code. Preventing such mismatches in test and production paths reduces the risk of real buffer overreads, potential information disclosure, and stability issues in the firmware DSP subsystem.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
2) Step 2: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not emit any CodeQL, SQL, pseudocode, or query fragments.
- Keep answers evidence-based and reference which provided field supported each major choice (e.g., “based on [PATCH_DIFF] hunk that adds X”).
- Output must be machine-parseable: keep the exact numbered section headings as above.
