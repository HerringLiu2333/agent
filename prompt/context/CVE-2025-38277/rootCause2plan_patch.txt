You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

CVE_NAME: CVE-2025-38277

[INFO]
[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]
    mtd: nand: ecc-mxic: Fix use of uninitialized variable ret
    If ctx->steps is zero, the loop processing ECC steps is skipped,
    and the variable ret remains uninitialized. It is later checked
    and returned, which leads to undefined behavior and may cause
    unpredictable results in user space or kernel crashes.
    
    This scenario can be triggered in edge cases such as misconfigured
    geometry, ECC engine misuse, or if ctx->steps is not validated
    after initialization.
    
    Initialize ret to zero before the loop to ensure correct and safe
    behavior regardless of the ctx->steps value.

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38277

2. Vulnerability Type
Use of uninitialized variable (undefined behavior; potential information disclosure and unpredictable control flow)

3. Root Cause Summary
In mxic_ecc_finish_io_req_external(), the status variable ret was only assigned inside a loop that iterates over ECC steps. When ctx->steps equals zero, the loop is skipped and ret remains uninitialized but is later checked and returned. This results in reading uninitialized stack memory, causing undefined behavior, erroneous return codes to user space, and potential kernel crashes.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
MTD (Memory Technology Device) NAND subsystem, Macronix ECC engine driver (ecc-mxic)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
The local variable ret in mxic_ecc_finish_io_req_external() was declared without initialization (“int nents, step, ret;”) and was only set within the per-step ECC processing loop. If no steps are processed (ctx->steps == 0), ret remains indeterminate but is subsequently checked and returned.

3) Trigger Condition:
ctx->steps equals zero (e.g., due to misconfigured geometry, ECC engine misuse, or lack of post-initialization validation), causing the loop over ECC steps to be skipped.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The function reads and returns an uninitialized stack variable. This can propagate unpredictable integers to user space as syscall return values, alter kernel control flow based on garbage data, and in some cases lead to kernel crashes.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Initialize ret to a safe default (0) at declaration to ensure a deterministic outcome even when no ECC steps are processed.

2) Key Code Changes:
In mxic_ecc_finish_io_req_external() at around line 614:
- Changed “int nents, step, ret;” to “int nents, step, ret = 0;”
This guarantees ret is valid regardless of whether the ECC-steps loop executes.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is a scalar initialization and does not modify locking, ordering, or concurrency behavior.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Uninitialized stack reads can lead to subtle and hard-to-reproduce failures, information disclosure via return values, and unstable error handling paths. This fix underscores the need for defensive initialization of status variables and validating configuration-derived loop bounds (e.g., ctx->steps) before use. Systematically eliminating uninitialized-variable uses in driver paths is crucial to prevent nondeterministic behavior and potential exposure of stack data to user space.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
