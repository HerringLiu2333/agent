You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38487

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to improper resource teardown/state management (Denial of Service)

3. Root Cause Summary
The driver lacked per-channel state tracking and unconditionally executed teardown operations (misc_deregister and kfifo_free) in aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop() even when a snoop channel had never been successfully enabled/registered. Specifically, the pre-patch code always called misc_deregister(&lpc_snoop->chan[channel].miscdev) without checking initialization, causing misc_deregister to dereference uninitialized/NULL internal members of struct miscdevice. This is triggered during platform device unbind/remove when disable is called for all channels regardless of prior enablement, leading to a kernel Oops. Additionally, aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop() lacked a guard against re-enabling an already-enabled channel, risking double-registration and subsequent invalid teardown.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
soc: aspeed: lpc-snoop (platform driver) using the miscdevice interface and regmap

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop() always performed:
  - hardware disable via regmap_update_bits
  - misc_deregister(&lpc_snoop->chan[channel].miscdev)
  - kfifo_free(&lpc_snoop->chan[channel].fifo)
- No check existed to confirm the channel had been enabled or the miscdevice registered, and no state variable recorded successful initialization.
- aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop() also lacked a guard against double enable, allowing inconsistent resource state.

3) Trigger Condition:
- User-initiated unbind via sysfs (echo …/unbind) causing device removal where the driver’s remove path disables channels that might never have been enabled or registered.
- The provided log shows a NULL pointer dereference in misc_deregister during aspeed_lpc_snoop_remove.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- misc_deregister invoked on an uninitialized struct miscdevice leads to NULL pointer dereference inside the misc subsystem, crashing the kernel (DoS).
- kfifo_free on an uninitialized FIFO could also cause invalid memory operations, compounding the crash risk.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Introduce a per-channel enabled flag to record successful initialization.
- Guard disable operations to only run when enabled; make enable idempotent-safe by rejecting re-enables.
- Update enabled state atomically with resource setup/teardown to maintain correct lifetime boundaries.

2) Key Code Changes:
- struct aspeed_lpc_snoop_channel gains bool enabled.
- aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop():
  - Early WARN_ON(lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled) and return -EBUSY to prevent double enable.
  - Set lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled = true after successful device registration and hardware enables.
- aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop():
  - Early return if !lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled to avoid tearing down non-existent resources.
  - Set enabled = false before misc_deregister and kfifo_free.
- Comment added noting possible safety improvements for concurrent readers.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- No new locks or synchronization primitives were introduced; the fix relies on a simple state flag to guard teardown.
- The comment suggests further work may be needed to coordinate with concurrent readers (e.g., file operations), but this patch addresses the immediate crash by preventing invalid deregistration and freeing when not enabled.
- Removal/unbind paths are typically serialized by the device core, minimizing races around the enabled flag in this context.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This change hardens resource lifecycle management by preventing invalid deregistration/free operations, removing a trivial local DoS vector via sysfs unbind. It enforces correct driver state transitions, reducing the risk of NULL dereferences and potential double free scenarios. While it does not add concurrency controls, it significantly improves robustness of the remove/teardown path and highlights the need for further synchronization around active readers to prevent future race-induced crashes.

Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).

- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
