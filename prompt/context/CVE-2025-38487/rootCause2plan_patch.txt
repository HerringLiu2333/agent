You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38487

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to improper resource state handling (missing enabled-state validation)

3. Root Cause Summary
The driver’s disable path unconditionally deregistered and freed per-channel resources regardless of whether a channel had ever been enabled/registered. Specifically, aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop() called misc_deregister() and kfifo_free() on a channel whose miscdevice/fifo had not been initialized, leading to a NULL pointer dereference inside misc_deregister(). The patch introduces an explicit per-channel enabled flag and uses it to guard both the enable (prevent double enable) and disable (avoid disabling a never-enabled or already-disabled channel) paths.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
ASPEED LPC snoop driver (drivers/soc/aspeed), miscdevice registration and FIFO management within aspeed_lpc_snoop_channel.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop() executed cleanup (misc_deregister(), kfifo_free()) without checking whether the target channel had been successfully enabled/registered. There was no per-channel state to indicate registration/initialization, so disable could run on uninitialized structures.

3) Trigger Condition:
Unbinding the platform device (e.g., writing device name to .../drivers/aspeed-lpc-snoop/unbind) causes remove -> aspeed_lpc_snoop_remove() to disable channels that may never have been enabled. This triggers misc_deregister() on an uninitialized miscdevice, as evidenced by the call trace and NULL dereference during unbind.

4) Impact Mechanism:
misc_deregister() expects a registered miscdevice (with internal pointers set). When called on an uninitialized channel, it dereferences a NULL internal pointer (e.g., miscdevice->this_device), causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference and Oops, resulting in a denial of service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce and maintain an explicit per-channel enabled state to serialize lifecycle transitions and guard cleanup. Refuse double-enabling and skip cleanup for channels that were never enabled or already disabled.

2) Key Code Changes:
- struct aspeed_lpc_snoop_channel gains a bool enabled field.
- aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop():
  - Adds WARN_ON(lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled) and returns -EBUSY to prevent double enable.
  - Sets lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled = true only after successful registration/configuration.
- aspeed_lpc_disable_snoop():
  - Returns early if !lpc_snoop->chan[channel].enabled, avoiding deregister/free on uninitialized objects.
  - Sets enabled = false before calling misc_deregister() and kfifo_free(), ensuring consistent state.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No new locks or memory barriers were introduced; state transitions are guarded by a simple boolean. The patch notes a potential need to “improve safety wrt concurrent reader(s),” indicating remaining concurrency considerations, but the immediate NULL deref is addressed by the enabled-state guard.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix prevents a kernel crash that could be triggered during device removal, improving robustness against denial-of-service conditions from erroneous or administrative operations. It reinforces correct lifecycle management of miscdevices and FIFOs, a common pattern across drivers, reducing the risk of similar NULL dereferences or double-free-like cleanup errors. While concurrency aspects remain largely unchanged, establishing explicit enable/disable state reduces misuse of core subsystems during teardown.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
