You are a senior static-analysis engineer and CodeQL design expert.
Task: Based only on the supplied materials, produce a human-readable detection plan (natural-language) for a CodeQL checker that would detect the same class of vulnerability described. DO NOT produce any query code or pseudocode — the output must be purely natural language steps and rationale.

Rules:
1. Only use evidence contained in the sections labeled [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. Do not invent facts.
2. The plan must be a step-by-step detection strategy in natural language (numbered steps). No code, no query snippets, no regex, no domain-specific language.
3. Each step must state: objective, signals to look for (AST/semantic patterns expressed conceptually), why it maps to the root cause, and how to reduce false positives.
4. Include a short test/validation strategy (what sample cases to run and expected outcomes).
5. List limitations and assumptions (what is Not determinable from inputs).
6. Keep the plan concise: overall ≤ 12 numbered steps and each step ≤ 2 concise sentences. Use bullets where helpful.
7. If information required to design an accurate checker is missing, state it explicitly under "Limitations & Assumptions".

[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]
1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38263

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference leading to kernel denial of service

3. Root Cause Summary
During error unwinding of cache set registration, code paths iterated over c->cache[] and unconditionally dereferenced ca->alloc_thread without verifying that ca was non-NULL. If bch_cache_set_alloc() failed early, register_cache_set() returned before populating c->cache[], leaving NULL entries; subsequent unregister/flush logic dereferenced ca->alloc_thread and crashed. The patch adds a NULL check for ca before accessing ca->alloc_thread.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- bcache (cache set registration/unregistration/flush paths)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- In the unregister/flush path, the code executed “if (ca->alloc_thread) kthread_stop(ca->alloc_thread);” inside a for_each_cache(ca, c, i) loop without first checking that ca was non-NULL (see [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] lines 1654–1656).
- This assumed c->cache[] entries were always initialized, which is not true when bch_cache_set_alloc() fails and register_cache_set() aborts before assigning ca->set->cache[...].

3) Trigger Condition:
- Any failure in bch_cache_set_alloc() during the initialization sequence (e.g., mempool/bioset/journal/btree allocations failing between lines 1860–1874) causes goto err and a call to bch_cache_set_unregister() (lines 1875, 1885), and register_cache_set() returns early (lines 2098–2100) before c->cache[] is filled (lines 2128–2129 would not run).
- bch_cache_set_unregister() queues the closure that runs the flush/unregister callback, which iterates c->cache[]; ca is NULL for entries never assigned, and dereferencing ca->alloc_thread triggers the crash (as evidenced by the oops and by [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] analysis).

4) Impact Mechanism:
- NULL pointer dereference in kernel context when accessing ca->alloc_thread in the unregister/flush callback, causing an Oops and potential system-wide denial of service (workqueue context: “cache_set_flush [bcache]”).

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Defensive programming: add a NULL guard before dereferencing the per-cache pointer within the unregister/flush path.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In static CLOSURE_CALLBACK(cache_set_unregister), the conditional was changed from:
  - “if (ca->alloc_thread)”
  to:
  - “if (ca && ca->alloc_thread)”
  ensuring ca is valid before accessing its alloc_thread member ([PATCH_DIFF] around line 1732).
- The accompanying comment explicitly ties the new check to failures in register_cache_set() → bch_cache_set_alloc().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- No locking or ordering changes; purely a NULL check added before dereference.
- This reduces the risk of crashes during concurrent teardown by tolerating partially initialized c->cache[] without requiring additional synchronization.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Highlights the importance of robust error-handling paths that may operate on partially initialized structures; such paths must not assume full population of arrays like c->cache[].
- Memory pressure or induced allocation failures during device registration can be leveraged to trigger kernel crashes if error paths lack NULL checks; strengthening these paths reduces attack surface for denial-of-service.
- Encourages use of NULL-safe iteration and clear initialization/teardown invariants in subsystems that perform complex multi-stage setup with deferred cleanup.

[REQUEST]
Produce a detection plan for a CodeQL-based static checker that would detect similar pre-patch flaws.
Requirements for the plan:
- High-level detection goal (1–2 lines).
- A numbered list of detection steps (objective, conceptual AST/semantic signals, FP mitigation).
- Types of program elements to target (functions, call sites, allocation sites, condition checks, lock boundaries, function return-value uses, etc.).
- Dataflow/taint patterns to consider (if applicable), described conceptually.
- Minimal test cases to validate the checker (positive/negative examples).
- Estimated effort/priority (low/medium/high) and likely false-positive sources.
- A short "Limitations & Assumptions" block.

OUTPUT FORMAT (produce exactly this structure; no extra text):
1. Plan Summary
{one-line summary}

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
2) Step 2: {objective — conceptual signals — FP mitigation}
...
(narrow to ≤12 steps)

3. Target Elements
- {list of element types to inspect}

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- {conceptual taint/flow rules to track}

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: {brief}
- Negative: {brief}
- Test harness notes: {brief}

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
{low/medium/high}

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- {list}

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- {explicit missing info or assumptions}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not emit any CodeQL, SQL, pseudocode, or query fragments.
- Keep answers evidence-based and reference which provided field supported each major choice (e.g., “based on [PATCH_DIFF] hunk that adds X”).
- Output must be machine-parseable: keep the exact numbered section headings as above.
