1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57973

2. Vulnerability Type
Integer overflow in allocation size calculation leading to potential heap-based buffer overflow (undersized allocation)

3. Root Cause Summary
The function copy_gl_to_skb_pkt computed the skb allocation size using plain addition: gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header) - pktshift. On 32-bit systems, gl->tot_len (user-controlled via process_responses()) could be large enough that the additive terms overflow and wrap, producing a much smaller allocation than required. Subsequent packet/header data copying into the skb would then overrun the allocated buffer. The pre-patch logic lacked overflow-safe arithmetic for size_t additions when deriving allocation sizes.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
RDMA Chelsio cxgb4 driver (drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4), function copy_gl_to_skb_pkt in device.c

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Unprotected size calculation using native 32-bit arithmetic for the skb allocation length in copy_gl_to_skb_pkt, directly summing user-influenced gl->tot_len with header sizes without overflow checks.

3) Trigger Condition:
On 32-bit kernels, if gl->tot_len from process_responses() is large enough that gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header) exceeds SIZE_MAX/UINT_MAX, the addition wraps around to a smaller value before subtracting pktshift.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The wrapped result causes alloc_skb() to allocate an undersized buffer. The function then proceeds to populate the skb with gl data and headers, potentially writing beyond the end of the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption and kernel crash or other undefined behavior.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce overflow-safe size computation using size_add() to prevent integer wrapping when adding gl->tot_len and the combined header sizes, ensuring alloc_skb() receives either a correct size or an overflow-saturated value that causes allocation to fail safely.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replaced:
  skb = alloc_skb(gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header) - pktshift, GFP_ATOMIC);
- With:
  skb = alloc_skb(size_add(gl->tot_len, sizeof(struct cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header)) - pktshift, GFP_ATOMIC);
This directly targets the overflow-prone addition by using size_add() for gl->tot_len + headers.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is purely arithmetic for allocation size computation; no locks or ordering were introduced or modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix reinforces the use of overflow-safe helpers for allocation size computations, particularly critical in network/RDMA paths where user-controlled lengths can reach kernel code. Ensuring size_t arithmetic cannot wrap prevents undersized allocations and subsequent overflows, a common class of memory safety vulnerabilities. Adopting helpers like size_add() reduces risk across 32-bit builds and improves robustness against malformed or hostile inputs reaching low-level drivers.
