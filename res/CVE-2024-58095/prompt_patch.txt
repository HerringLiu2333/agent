1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58095

2. Vulnerability Type
Missing state validation (improper enforcement of read-only mount) leading to illegal journaling/metadata modification attempts and potential kernel error/crash

3. Root Cause Summary
extAlloc() and extRecord() in fs/jfs/jfs_extent.c unconditionally invoked txBeginAnon(ip->i_sb) without verifying that the inode/superblock was not mounted read-only. This missing read-only state check allowed transaction initiation on a read-only filesystem, violating mount semantics and leading to errors or crashes in the journaling/extent allocation paths.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
JFS (fs/jfs), specifically extent allocation/recording and journaling transaction initiation in fs/jfs/jfs_extent.c (extAlloc(), extRecord(), txBeginAnon()).

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Both extAlloc() (around line ~74) and extRecord() (around line ~258) called txBeginAnon(ip->i_sb) regardless of mount state; no isReadOnly() check was performed prior to starting a transaction. The unconditional transaction start on a read-only superblock is a logic/state validation error.

3) Trigger Condition:
Attempting operations that reach extAlloc()/extRecord() while the filesystem is mounted read-only. The provided call trace shows this can occur via the write path: extAlloc -> jfs_get_block -> __block_write_begin_int -> block_write_begin -> jfs_write_begin, on a read-only mount, leading to txBeginAnon being called.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Initiating a journaling transaction on a read-only filesystem can result in internal errors or kernel crashes in JFS journaling/extent code paths (as per the patch description). It also represents an attempted metadata modification in violation of read-only semantics, potentially causing inconsistent state or triggering error handling that crashes.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce a precondition check to enforce read-only mount semantics before any transaction begins. If isReadOnly(ip) is true, log an error and return -EIO, preventing txBeginAnon() from being invoked.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In extAlloc(): added:
  if (isReadOnly(ip)) { jfs_error(ip->i_sb, "read-only filesystem\n"); return -EIO; }
  directly before the existing txBeginAnon(ip->i_sb) call.
- In extRecord(): added the same read-only check and early return before txBeginAnon(ip->i_sb).
These changes gate transaction initiation on mount state and stop extent allocation/recording on read-only filesystems.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking primitives were added or altered. The change introduces an early return in extRecord() before mutex_lock(&JFS_IP(ip)->commit_mutex), which prevents acquiring commit_mutex on read-only mounts; this reduces the chance of entering inconsistent transactional states but does not modify locking behavior elsewhere.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Enforcing read-only state checks before initiating filesystem transactions hardens JFS against illegal write paths and prevents potential denial-of-service via crashes triggered by journaling on read-only mounts. It underscores the need for consistent mount-state validation across all write/transactional entry points in filesystems. Similar checks should be audited in other JFS and VFS interaction points to ensure read-only semantics are uniformly upheld.
