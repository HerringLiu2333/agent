1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58066

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect error handling

3. Root Cause Summary
The probe function used IS_ERR()/PTR_ERR() to validate the result of devm_kzalloc(), but devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on failure, not error pointers. Because IS_ERR(NULL) evaluates false, the code continued execution with pxa_unit == NULL and dereferenced it, causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference. The patch replaces the incorrect IS_ERR/PTR_ERR handling with a proper NULL check returning -ENOMEM.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock subsystem, Marvell MMP PXA1908 APBCP driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-apbcp.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In pxa1908_apbcp_probe(), after allocating pxa_unit with devm_kzalloc(), the code checked:
“if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
This mismatched check failed to catch allocation failure (NULL), allowing subsequent dereference of pxa_unit.

3) Trigger Condition:
Allocation failure in devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL) yielding NULL (e.g., under memory pressure during device probe).

4) Impact Mechanism:
With pxa_unit == NULL, the next line “pxa_unit->base = devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);” dereferences NULL, leading to a kernel oops/panic and denial of service during device initialization.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Correct the failure check for devm_kzalloc() by testing for NULL and returning -ENOMEM, preventing use of a NULL pointer.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replaced:
  “if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
  with:
  “if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;”
No other logic changes; subsequent IS_ERR() check remains for pxa_unit->base, which may return an ERR_PTR from devm_platform_ioremap_resource().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is confined to error handling in the probe path; no locks or concurrency mechanisms were added or modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Correct error-handling patterns for devm_* allocation APIs are critical to avoid NULL dereferences that can crash the kernel, especially during device probing at boot or module insertion. This fix prevents a straightforward denial-of-service condition under memory pressure and reinforces consistent use of NULL checks versus IS_ERR() depending on API semantics. Ensuring accurate failure detection improves kernel robustness and reduces the attack surface of driver initialization paths.
