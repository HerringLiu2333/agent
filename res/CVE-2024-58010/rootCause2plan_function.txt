1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence to define the vulnerability class; propose a guard-delta-driven detection plan contingent on patch and root-cause details, which are missing.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify the specific guard or validation introduced by the patch — Signals: inspect [PATCH_DIFF] for newly added conditions, error checks, early returns, or protective calls — FP mitigation: None possible without [PATCH_DIFF].
2) Step 2: Objective: Determine the risky operation(s) guarded by the new check — Signals: locate the statement(s)/call(s) immediately controlled by the added guard in [PATCH_DIFF] — FP mitigation: None possible without [PATCH_DIFF].
3) Step 3: Objective: Define the pre-patch vulnerable pattern as performing the risky operation without the guard — Signals: in [FUNCTION_CONTENT], find occurrences of the risky operation lacking the identified guard path — FP mitigation: constrain to same function/module context indicated by [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT].
4) Step 4: Objective: Model the guard’s logical predicate(s) and scope — Signals: capture variables, state, or conditions referenced by the added guard — FP mitigation: ensure semantic equivalence (same variables/conditions) when checking for missing guards.
5) Step 5: Objective: Search for code paths where the risky operation is reachable without satisfying the guard — Signals: control-flow paths from function entry to sink where guard condition is absent or not dominating — FP mitigation: require dominance or path coverage analysis to avoid paths already guarded elsewhere.
6) Step 6: Objective: If the patch enforces a precondition (e.g., prevalidation), detect calls where the precondition function is not invoked — Signals: calls to sink function(s) without preceding call to the guard/validator shown in [PATCH_DIFF] — FP mitigation: allow equivalent validators if syntactically or semantically identical to the added guard.
7) Step 7: Objective: If the patch adds error handling on return values, detect unhandled or misused returns pre-patch — Signals: uses of return values from risky APIs without checks introduced in [PATCH_DIFF] — FP mitigation: exclude cases with alternative, logically equivalent checks verified via control-flow predicates.
8) Step 8: Objective: If the patch adds resource/lock discipline, detect operations outside required lock boundaries — Signals: operations similar to those inside new lock scopes occurring without lock acquisition — FP mitigation: restrict to same resources/locks evidenced by [PATCH_DIFF].
9) Step 9: Objective: If the patch adds bounds/NULL/state checks, detect dereferences or state-dependent actions without these checks — Signals: deref/state use on variables guarded in [PATCH_DIFF] but used unguarded elsewhere — FP mitigation: confirm variable identity and aliasing to avoid unrelated uses.
10) Step 10: Objective: If data validation was added, model taint to the sink — Signals: flows from untrusted inputs to sink operations that the patch now sanitizes — FP mitigation: restrict sources/sinks to those explicitly indicated by [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT].
11) Step 11: Objective: Report only instances matching the same function or call-site pattern as patched — Signals: match function names, file/module, and call signatures from [PATCH_DIFF] — FP mitigation: limit to the exact APIs/path patterns changed by the patch.
12) Step 12: Objective: Validate findings against [FUNCTION_CONTENT] to ensure contextual match — Signals: cross-check variable names, control structures, and surrounding logic — FP mitigation: discard matches lacking these contextual cues.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and call sites modified or referenced in [PATCH_DIFF].
- Condition checks (guards, early returns) added in [PATCH_DIFF].
- Risky operations/sinks directly controlled by the added guard.
- Return-value uses from APIs altered in [PATCH_DIFF].
- Lock boundaries or resource management constructs introduced in [PATCH_DIFF].

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows into the risky operation that the patch now guards or sanitizes.
- Consider precondition calls as sanitizers; treat absence as tainted flow to sink.
- Limit sources and sinks strictly to entities visible in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT].

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function executing the identified risky operation without the guard/validation shown in [PATCH_DIFF], reaching the sink on a path where the guard does not dominate.
- Negative: The same function with the guard/validation present as in [PATCH_DIFF], ensuring the sink is only reachable under guarded conditions.
- Test harness notes: Use minimal stubs mirroring names and control-flow context from [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT] to validate dominance and call-sequence checks.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Unknown; contingent on the specifics of the missing [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative, equivalent guards not syntactically identical to the patch; mitigate by semantic predicate matching.
- Different functions with similar names but unrelated semantics; mitigate by module/file scoping from [PATCH_DIFF].
- Paths that appear unguarded due to incomplete interprocedural analysis; mitigate by requiring dominance or explicit call-sequence evidence.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [FUNCTION_CONTENT] are missing; no concrete signals can be defined.
- [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] is missing; cannot map checks to a specific vulnerability class.
- Assumes the patch adds a guard/validation around a risky operation; exact nature of guard, sources, and sinks is unknown.
- The plan is a template that requires populating with specifics from the missing materials before implementation.
