1. Plan Summary
Template, delta-driven checker to flag paths that reach sensitive operations without the preconditions/validations introduced by the fix for CVE-2024-58010; concrete signals depend on the (missing) patch/root-cause details.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify the concrete “sensitive sinks” and code regions modified by the fix; Signals — functions/operations that the patch adds guards around, wraps, or relocates; FP mitigation — restrict to exactly the symbol set and locations changed in the patch once available.
2) Step 2: Objective — Infer the guard pattern(s) added by the fix; Signals — newly added conditionals, early returns, capability/permission checks, null/range/state checks, error-handling branches dominating the sink(s); FP mitigation — require dominance/postdomination relationships (guard must control all paths to the sink) and semantic equivalence (matching operands/variables).
3) Step 3: Objective — Detect sink usages lacking equivalent guards; Signals — control-flow paths reaching the same sink(s) without a syntactically or semantically equivalent check; FP mitigation — treat logically equivalent guards (including helper predicates) as satisfying the precondition to avoid flagging already-safe sites.
4) Step 4: Objective — If the fix added a sanitizer/normalizer wrapper, ensure it is applied; Signals — call sequences where input flows to the sink without passing through the newly introduced sanitizer/wrapper; FP mitigation — accept alternative, provably equivalent sanitizers by whitelisting known safe helpers when identified from the patch.
5) Step 5: Objective — If the fix enforced return-value checking, detect unchecked/misinterpreted returns; Signals — call to the patched function whose return value is unused, not compared against the patched condition, or compared incorrectly relative to the fixed semantics; FP mitigation — allow patterns where the value is propagated to a central check or assert that dominates the sink.
6) Step 6: Objective — If the fix added bounds/size validation, find unbounded operations; Signals — dataflow from size/index sources into memory/array/string operations at the sink without a prior bounds/length check introduced by the patch; FP mitigation — require proof that the same variable (or an alias) was validated with a compatible relational check.
7) Step 7: Objective — If the fix added locking/state preconditions, detect unprotected access; Signals — accesses or calls to the same resource/critical section outside the lock/guarded state region established in the patch; FP mitigation — model lock/unlock or state transitions and only flag when the lock/state is provably not held.
8) Step 8: Objective — If the fix changed lifetime/refcount handling, catch leaks/double-ops; Signals — missing increments/decrements, missing frees, or double frees around the same object flows that the patch adjusted; FP mitigation — pair operations (alloc/free, get/put) across all paths and ignore paths where pairing is provably complete.
9) Step 9: Objective — If the fix added input provenance checks, track tainted inputs to sinks; Signals — flows from external/untrusted sources to the sink without the newly added provenance/authorization checks; FP mitigation — intersect taint with the precise source kinds implicated by the patch and require reachability to the same sink kind.

3. Target Elements
- Function and method call sites corresponding to patched functions/sinks.
- Conditional guards and early-return checks dominating those call sites.
- Sanitizer/wrapper calls introduced by the patch and their arguments.
- Return-value uses and comparisons for patched APIs.
- Memory/string/array operations if the patch added bounds checks.
- Lock/unlock or state-guarding constructs, and critical-section boundaries.
- Allocation/free and reference-count increment/decrement sites.
- Data sources marked untrusted by the patch context (e.g., parameters, I/O).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from identified sources (per patch) to the sensitive sinks, ensuring the path intersects required guard/sanitizer nodes.
- Model control dependencies: a guard must dominate the sink on all paths; absence indicates a violation.
- Model resource/lock/state: ensure the required state predicate holds on entry to the sink region.
- Model lifetime pairing: ensure every allocate/get has a corresponding free/put along all paths.
- Model return-value propagation: ensure result is checked against the fixed condition before use or before proceeding to the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-fix snippet where a call to the sensitive sink is made without the newly introduced guard/sanitizer/lock/return check, and where tainted/unbounded data flows into the sink.
- Negative: A post-fix snippet mirroring the patch where the guard dominates the sink, the sanitizer wraps inputs, locks are held appropriately, and return values are validated as per the fix.
- Test harness notes: Create minimal functions illustrating each guarded pattern introduced by the patch and include variants with equivalent custom checks to verify FP mitigations.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — Requires deriving concrete sink and guard patterns from the patch and modeling control/dataflow and simple state (locks/lifetimes).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Custom guard helpers semantically equivalent to the patch’s guard but syntactically different — mitigate by allowing user-configurable equivalence/whitelisting.
- Macro-expanded checks obscuring guard recognition — mitigate by analyzing post-expansion AST or matching on canonicalized conditions.
- Context-dependent safety (e.g., invariants established by callers) — mitigate by honoring dominance/postdomination and interprocedural propagation of preconditions.
- Multiple alternative safe patterns (e.g., different lock ordering) — mitigate by modeling resource states, not just syntactic lock calls.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Critical information is missing: both [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are unavailable, so concrete sinks, guard patterns, and data/lock/lifetime specifics cannot be enumerated.
- The plan assumes the fix added explicit preconditions (guards, sanitization, locking, lifetime, or return checks); if the fix is unrelated (e.g., architectural change), this template may not apply.
- Assumes source language, framework, and API surfaces implicated by CVE-2024-58010; without them, symbol extraction and equivalence matching cannot be finalized.
