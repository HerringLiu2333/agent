1. Plan Summary
Evidence is missing for CVE-2024-58010; propose a methodological, evidence-gated plan that derives the vulnerability signature from patch artifacts and then detects pre-patch code lacking those safeguards.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective—determine the remediation signature. Conceptual signals—scan [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION] for added guard conditions, error handling, safe-API replacements, lock acquisitions, or permission checks; none are available here. FP mitigation—defer specifics until actual patch artifacts are present; otherwise avoid emitting findings.

2) Step 2: Objective—identify the protected sinks introduced by the patch. Conceptual signals—calls or operations that in the patch become wrapped by new checks (e.g., conditionals, validation calls, try/catch, permission gates); not derivable without [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation—require that the same sink appears both guarded in patched code and unguarded in candidate code paths.

3) Step 3: Objective—model the missing precondition(s) as a check predicate. Conceptual signals—boolean conditions, null/bounds checks, capability/permission validations, concurrency locks that the patch enforces; absent given no [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. FP mitigation—limit to predicates conclusively tied to the patched sinks (same function or immediate caller/callee).

4) Step 4: Objective—find pre-patch code paths where the sink is reachable without the remediation predicate. Conceptual signals—control-flow paths invoking the sink without preceding validation/lock/permission check observed in the patch. FP mitigation—require dominance: the predicate must dominate the sink in patched code and be absent along candidate paths.

5) Step 5: Objective—scope to the same APIs and modules altered by the patch. Conceptual signals—functions/files/modules referenced in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FILE_CONTENT]; unavailable here. FP mitigation—do not generalize beyond the specific APIs; restrict to exact symbol names seen in the patch.

6) Step 6: Objective—connect input or state that the patch newly validates to the sink. Conceptual signals—dataflow from parameters/fields/environment to the sink that is newly sanitized or checked in patch. FP mitigation—only flag when such data can reach the sink without passing through the patch-introduced validation.

7) Step 7: Objective—capture concurrency/resource discipline if the patch adds locks or closes lifecycles. Conceptual signals—added lock acquisition/release, reference counting, lifecycle checks before resource use; not confirmable without [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation—flag only when the same resource/sink is used without holding the required lock or state.

8) Step 8: Objective—encode error-handling improvements from the patch. Conceptual signals—added returns, exceptions, or error checks guarding the sink. FP mitigation—require that the pre-patch path lacks any equivalent early exit/error check.

9) Step 9: Objective—exclude benign occurrences. Conceptual signals—presence of alternative protective mechanisms equivalent to the patch predicate (e.g., earlier validation in caller). FP mitigation—perform inter-procedural check to see if upstream callers enforce the predicate; if yes, suppress.

10) Step 10: Objective—rank findings by risk. Conceptual signals—sinks that are externally reachable or process untrusted inputs; cannot be identified without [FILE_CONTENT]. FP mitigation—prefer public/exported entry points and paths with user-controlled parameters once sources are known.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch (names and files from [PATCH_DIFF]/[FILE_CONTENT]).
- Call sites of sinks that the patch newly guards.
- Condition checks, validation calls, permission/capability gates, and lock boundaries added in the patch.
- Control-flow around sink invocation (dominance of checks).
- Function return-value uses and error-handling pathways added by the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track data reaching the patched sink from parameters/fields that the patch starts validating.
- Treat the patch-introduced validation/sanitization as a barrier; flag paths where the barrier is absent.
- If the patch adds locking/state checks, treat “holding the lock/valid state” as a predicate guarding resource use; flag uses without that predicate.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function invokes the identified sink with no preceding predicate/validation/lock that the patch later adds, and input/state flows directly to the sink unabated.
- Negative: The same sink invocation preceded by the exact guard/validation/lock introduced in the patch, or an equivalent upstream check dominating the sink.
- Test harness notes: Build minimal files mirroring the patched function and an unpatched variant; verify the checker flags only the unpatched variant once patch-specific signals are configured.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High—specific signals cannot be defined without [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[FILE_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; implementing a robust, low-noise checker requires patch-derived details.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Missing context on equivalent validations elsewhere—mitigate via inter-procedural dominance checks.
- Overgeneralizing sink patterns—mitigate by binding exactly to symbols/files from [PATCH_DIFF].
- Misclassifying unrelated checks as the remediation—mitigate by requiring the check-to-sink pairing observed in patched code.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the vulnerability class and concrete signals are unknown.
- Language, framework, APIs, and module scope are unspecified.
- The plan is methodological and contingent on acquiring patch artifacts to instantiate the checker’s predicates, sinks, and dataflow sources.
