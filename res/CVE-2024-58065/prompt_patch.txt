1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58065

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to improper error handling (misuse of IS_ERR/PTR_ERR with a NULL-returning allocator)

3. Root Cause Summary
The probe routine pxa1908_apbc_probe() treated the result of devm_kzalloc() as if it could be an ERR_PTR and checked it with IS_ERR(). Since devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on failure, the IS_ERR() check never triggered on allocation failure. The code then proceeded to use the NULL pointer (pxa_unit), leading to a NULL pointer dereference during device probe. The patch replaces the erroneous IS_ERR/PTR_ERR logic with a correct NULL check and returns -ENOMEM, preventing dereference of a NULL allocation result.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock framework (drivers/clk), Marvell MMP PXA1908 APBC driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-apbc.c), function pxa1908_apbc_probe().

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
After allocating pxa_unit with devm_kzalloc(), the code did:
“if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
This is incorrect for devm_kzalloc(), which returns NULL on failure, not ERR_PTRs, so allocation failure was not detected.

3) Trigger Condition:
devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL) returning NULL (e.g., due to memory pressure or fault injection) during the device probe path.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Subsequent use of pxa_unit when it is NULL causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops/panic during probe and a denial of service. Additionally, the error path would not properly report -ENOMEM, impairing correct error propagation.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Correct the error handling to match devm_kzalloc() semantics by checking for NULL and returning -ENOMEM on failure, preventing use of a NULL pointer.

2) Key Code Changes:
In pxa1908_apbc_probe():
- Replaced:
  “if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
- With:
  “if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;”
This directly aligns the check with devm_kzalloc()’s NULL-on-error contract.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is confined to allocation failure handling and does not alter locking, ordering, or concurrency behavior.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix prevents a crash-only class issue that can be triggered on allocation failure in the probe path, improving kernel robustness against low-memory conditions or fault-injection scenarios. Similar misuse patterns (IS_ERR() on kmalloc/devm_kzalloc results) can exist in other drivers and should be audited. While this bug is unlikely to enable privilege escalation, it facilitates denial-of-service by crashing the kernel during device initialization if allocation fails. Properly returning -ENOMEM also ensures accurate error reporting to the driver core and avoids ambiguous success paths on failure.
