1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58065

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to improper error handling (incorrect NULL vs ERR_PTR check)

3. Root Cause Summary
In pxa1908_apbc_probe(), the code checked devm_kzalloc()â€™s return value using IS_ERR()/PTR_ERR, but devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on failure, not ERR_PTR. This mischeck failed to detect allocation failure, allowing execution to proceed and dereference a NULL pxa_unit, causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference during driver probe.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock subsystem, Marvell PXA1908 APBC driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-apbc.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In pxa1908_apbc_probe(), after "pxa_unit = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL);", the code erroneously did "if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);". IS_ERR(NULL) is false, so a NULL allocation result was treated as success.

3) Trigger Condition:
devm_kzalloc() fails and returns NULL (e.g., under memory pressure or allocation failure) during platform driver probe.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The subsequent line "pxa_unit->base = devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);" dereferences pxa_unit, which is NULL, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference (oops/panic) and device probe failure, potentially impacting system boot stability.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Correct the error handling by checking for NULL and returning a proper -ENOMEM code when devm_kzalloc() fails.

2) Key Code Changes:
Within pxa1908_apbc_probe():
- Replaced:
  "if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);"
- With:
  "if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;"
This aligns the check with devm_kzalloc() semantics. The existing IS_ERR() check for devm_platform_ioremap_resource() remains appropriate, as that API returns ERR_PTR on failure.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is limited to allocation failure handling in probe; no locks, ordering, or concurrency behavior was modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Correctly distinguishing NULL-returning allocators from ERR_PTR-returning APIs is essential to avoid probe-time crashes and denial-of-service conditions. This fix improves robustness of the clock driver during initialization and reduces the risk that memory allocation failures can be escalated into system instability. It highlights the need for consistent error handling patterns across drivers using devm_* helpers.
