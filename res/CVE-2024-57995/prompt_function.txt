1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57995

2. Vulnerability Type
Use-after-free (read-after-free) due to stale pointer access after unassignment

3. Root Cause Summary
In ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(), when the vif’s link is moved across radios, the function may call ath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(arvif) which frees and clears the arvif pointer. Immediately afterward, the pre-patch code performs a check on the freed pointer (“if (arvif->is_created) goto flush;”), causing a read-after-free. The subsequent flush path also dereferences the stale arvif in ath12k_mac_vif_cache_flush(), compounding the UAF risk. The patch fixes this by moving the is_created check to after arvif is re-assigned via ath12k_mac_assign_link_vif(), restoring pointer validity before use.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/mac.c (ath12k MAC/vdev assignment logic)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Incorrect ordering/lifetime handling: after possibly freeing arvif via ath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(arvif), the code immediately reads arvif->is_created before reassigning arvif, leading to use of a freed pointer.

3) Trigger Condition:
Multi-radio configurations when ar != arvif->ar, causing ath12k_mac_remove_link_interface(hw, arvif) followed by ath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(arvif); then the stale check “if (arvif->is_created) goto flush;” runs before arvif is re-assigned.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Read-after-free of arvif->is_created and subsequent dereferences (e.g., ath12k_mac_vif_cache_flush(ar, arvif)) can cause kernel memory corruption, unpredictable behavior, or crashes due to accessing freed memory.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Reorder the logic to ensure arvif is reassigned (via ath12k_mac_assign_link_vif()) before any dereferences or state checks, thereby eliminating reads on a freed pointer.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Removed early check:
  “if (arvif->is_created) goto flush;”
- Added the same check after reassigning arvif:
  after “arvif = ath12k_mac_assign_link_vif(ah, vif, link_id);”
This ensures all subsequent uses of arvif, including is_created checks and cache flush, operate on a valid object.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking changes; lockdep_assert_wiphy(hw->wiphy) remains the only lock validation. The fix addresses pointer lifetime/ordering, not synchronization primitives.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This highlights the importance of strict pointer lifetime management in complex driver flows where objects may be unassigned and reallocated across hardware contexts. Ensuring no stale pointer reads after teardown paths prevents UAFs that can be triggered by normal wireless operations (e.g., scan or channel context changes). Similar reordering and validation should be audited in other ath12k and wireless subsystems to avoid latent UAFs and improve overall kernel robustness.
