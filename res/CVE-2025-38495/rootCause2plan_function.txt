1. Plan Summary
Detect heap buffer under-allocation in HID report buffer allocators that compute size as hid_report_len(report) + 7 without reserving an extra byte when report->id == 0, which can lead to out-of-bounds access when used by hid_output_report() or .raw_request() (based on PATCH_DIFF and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify candidate allocator functions — Look for functions that compute a length from hid_report_len(report) plus a constant 7 and allocate with kzalloc/kmalloc, returning a u8*/char* (from FUNCTION_CONTENT and PATCH_DIFF). Restrict to functions taking struct hid_report* to match HID core usage and reduce noise.

2) Step 2: Check for missing report ID accommodation — In those functions, verify the length computation does not reference report->id and is not conditionally incremented when report->id == 0 (from PATCH_DIFF and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). Flag only when there is no syntactic dependence on report->id in any len adjustment to pinpoint the off-by-one under-allocation cause.

3) Step 3: Confirm HID usage context — Ensure the allocated buffer flows (via return or assignment) to calls associated with HID transmission such as hid_output_report() or a raw request path (mentioned in PATCH_DIFF comment and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). Use dataflow from the allocator’s return to arguments of functions named hid_output_report or identifiers containing raw_request to reduce false positives.

4) Step 4: Validate the “7 extra bytes” heuristic — Require that the constant added is exactly 7 to match the specific 8-byte-chunk padding pattern called out in the comments (“implement() working on 8 byte chunks,” in FUNCTION_CONTENT and PATCH_DIFF). This ties the finding to the documented pre-patch flaw rather than arbitrary constants.

5) Step 5: Check reachability for report->id == 0 — For each call site to the allocator, inspect whether there is a dominating check enforcing report->id != 0; if none, assume id can be 0 (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS trigger condition). Suppress if all call paths prove report->id is nonzero, reducing false positives where the condition cannot occur.

6) Step 6: Corroborate reserved first-byte usage — Where available, look for subsequent uses that treat the first byte as a reserved report ID (e.g., passing the buffer to .raw_request or hid_output_report which are documented to expect the first byte to be 0 per PATCH_DESCRIPTION). Use this as a strengthening condition; do not require it if Step 3 already confirms the HID report path.

7) Step 7: Ensure the computed len is the exact allocator argument — Verify the computed len variable is the value passed to kzalloc/kmalloc and not further adjusted afterward (FUNCTION_CONTENT). This ensures we flag the effective allocation size rather than intermediate computations.

8) Step 8: Exclude already-fixed patterns — If the length expression already includes a conditional increment equivalent to +(report->id == 0) or an if-branch that increments len when report->id == 0 (from PATCH_DIFF), do not flag. This prevents flagging code that matches the post-patch fix approach.

3. Target Elements
- Functions that: compute a length from hid_report_len(report) + 7; allocate via kzalloc/kmalloc; return the allocated buffer.
- Function parameters and member accesses: struct hid_report* report, report->id.
- Allocation sites: kzalloc/kmalloc call arguments.
- Call sites that consume the allocated buffer: calls to hid_output_report and functions/fields containing raw_request.
- Control-flow guards at call sites: checks on report->id (e.g., report->id != 0).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from hid_report_len(report) through the length computation to the size argument of kzalloc/kmalloc.
- Track the returned allocation pointer from the allocator to its use sites, specifically into hid_output_report or raw_request.
- Track control-flow predicates at call sites to determine if report->id is constrained to nonzero; if unconstrained, treat as potentially zero (per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS trigger condition).

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function identical to pre-patch hid_alloc_report_buf that computes u32 len = hid_report_len(report) + 7; returns kzalloc(len, flags); buffer then passed to hid_output_report — expect a finding (FUNCTION_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Positive: An allocator computing hid_report_len(report) + 7 and returning kzalloc without any reference to report->id, later passed to a raw_request-like function — expect a finding (PATCH_DESCRIPTION mentions .raw_request()).
- Negative: The post-patch pattern u32 len = hid_report_len(report) + 7 + (report->id == 0); — expect no finding (PATCH_DIFF).
- Negative: An allocator that increases len by 1 under if (report->id == 0) before allocation — expect no finding (PATCH_DIFF equivalent).
- Test harness notes: Include at least one caller with and without a dominating guard report->id != 0 to exercise Step 5’s reachability filter.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — The pattern is well-scoped with clear APIs and constants (hid_report_len, +7, report->id), and the impact is memory corruption in kernel paths (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Allocators using +7 for unrelated protocols: mitigate by requiring struct hid_report* and hid_report_len(report).
- Code where report->id is provably nonzero along all call paths: mitigate by examining dominating conditions and suppress when enforced.
- Buffers not used in HID output/raw paths: mitigate by requiring dataflow to hid_output_report or raw_request-like sinks when possible.
- Variants where names differ or raw_request is invoked via indirect calls: partially mitigate by focusing on HID helper types and hid_output_report; document as limitation.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes availability of identifiable sinks (hid_output_report or raw_request) as per PATCH_DESCRIPTION/ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS; indirect calls to .raw_request may evade name-based matching.
- Does not prove at compile time that low-level drivers will write a reserved 0 byte; relies on HID semantics described in PATCH_DESCRIPTION.
- Cannot fully determine value ranges for report->id; treats lack of constraints as potentially zero per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
- Focused on the exact +7 pattern linked to 8-byte chunking; other under-allocation patterns with different constants are out of scope based on provided evidence.
