1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38317

2. Vulnerability Type
Heap-based buffer overflow in a debugfs write handler

3. Root Cause Summary
The debugfs write handler ath12k_write_htt_stats_type allocated a fixed-size 32-byte heap buffer and accepted an arbitrary user-supplied write length (count) without validating it against the buffer size. When a user wrote more than 32 bytes, subsequent processing wrote past the end of the allocated buffer, causing kernel heap memory corruption. The patch adds a strict upper bound check on count to prevent writes larger than the buffer.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- Wireless networking (ath12k) debugfs interface

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- The function used a fixed buffer “const int size = 32; char *buf = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);” but lacked any check that the incoming write size (count) did not exceed 32 bytes before writing into buf.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Writing more than 32 bytes to the ath12k debugfs file handled by ath12k_write_htt_stats_type.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Writing count > 32 bytes led to data being stored past the 32-byte heap allocation, corrupting adjacent kernel heap memory; outcomes include kernel crashes (DoS) or potentially controllable memory corruption.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Input validation: reject writes larger than the fixed buffer by validating count against the 32-byte limit and returning an error.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added:
  - “if (count > size) return -EINVAL;”
- Existing context shows “const int size = 32; … char *buf = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);” indicating the buffer is heap-allocated and fixed-size; the new guard aligns write size with buffer capacity.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The change is a simple parameter validation prior to allocation/use; it does not alter locking, ordering, or concurrency behavior.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Even though debugfs is typically restricted to privileged users, unbounded writes in kernel interfaces can yield reliable kernel heap corruption primitives, risking local privilege escalation or system instability. This fix reinforces the need for strict length validation for all user-controlled inputs, including in debug paths, to prevent memory safety violations.
