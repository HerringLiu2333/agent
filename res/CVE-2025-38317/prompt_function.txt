1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38317

2. Vulnerability Type
Heap-based buffer overflow (memory corruption) in a debugfs write handler due to missing input length validation.

3. Root Cause Summary
The function ath12k_write_htt_stats_type allocates a fixed-size 32-byte buffer and then copies user-provided data into it using copy_from_user(buf, user_buf, count) without verifying that count â‰¤ 32. This missing bounds check allows writes larger than the buffer, causing a heap overflow. The patch adds an explicit size check (if (count > size) return -EINVAL;) before allocating and using the buffer, preventing out-of-bounds writes.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
ath12k Wi-Fi driver debugfs interface (function: ath12k_write_htt_stats_type).

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
A fixed-size buffer (size = 32) is allocated with kzalloc, but the subsequent copy_from_user uses the unvalidated count from userspace, enabling copying more than 32 bytes into the buffer.

3) Trigger Condition:
A debugfs write operation where the user supplies more than 32 bytes to the file handled by ath12k_write_htt_stats_type; debugfs is generally restricted to root, but the kernel still processes the oversized input.

4) Impact Mechanism:
copy_from_user writes beyond the 32-byte allocation, corrupting adjacent kernel heap memory (out-of-bounds write), potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or undefined behavior within the kernel.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Input length validation is added to reject oversized writes; the function now returns -EINVAL if count exceeds the fixed buffer size, ensuring safe copying.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Inserted:
  if (count > size)
      return -EINVAL;
- This check is placed immediately after determining size and before allocating the buffer and performing copy_from_user.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes were made. Existing wiphy_lock/unlock around debug parameter updates remain unchanged; the fix solely addresses bounds checking before memory copy.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Even in privileged-only interfaces like debugfs, kernel code must validate user-controlled lengths before copying into fixed-size buffers to prevent memory corruption.
- Reliance on copy_from_user with unbounded count is a common pitfall; introducing explicit size checks or using helpers that clamp lengths helps avoid similar vulnerabilities.
- Such overflows in kernel space can destabilize the system and erode kernel integrity, highlighting the need for rigorous input validation across all user-kernel interfaces.
