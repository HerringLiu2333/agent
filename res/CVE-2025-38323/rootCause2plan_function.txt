1. Plan Summary
Detect pre-patch code paths where a safety/validation guard introduced by the patch is missing before executing the associated sensitive operation.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Derive the guard(s) the patch added; conceptual signals: new conditionals, early returns, range/null/state checks, or capability checks introduced around an operation (based on [PATCH_DIFF], which is missing); mapping: added guards typically encode the root-cause mitigation; FP mitigation: ignore non-semantic edits (formatting, logging-only changes).
2) Step 2: Objective: Identify the sensitive operation(s) protected by the new guard; signals: statements/calls that are now gated by the added check or moved under a new conditional; mapping: these are the sinks that were previously reachable without validation; FP mitigation: exclude operations that are only refactored (no new predicate governing reachability).
3) Step 3: Objective: Formulate a “required guard” predicate pattern; signals: the specific boolean expression(s) or helper/API call(s) used by the new check, including early-return/error-path; mapping: this pattern represents the missing precondition; FP mitigation: normalize logical equivalences (e.g., negation forms) to avoid misclassifying equivalent checks as missing.
4) Step 4: Objective: Find pre-patch call paths to the sensitive operation lacking the required guard; signals: control-flow reaching the operation without the predicate holding or without an equivalent prior check; mapping: missing guard on some path reproduces the vulnerability; FP mitigation: require path feasibility (no contradictory conditions) and path dominance (guard must dominate the sink).
5) Step 5: Objective: Recognize equivalent guards implemented via helper functions; signals: calls to small boolean-returning helpers that embody the same check as the patch’s inline condition; mapping: the root cause is absence of the semantic check, not necessarily its syntactic form; FP mitigation: treat helpers as equivalent only if they test the same variables/state and have no side effects unrelated to validation.
6) Step 6: Objective: Propagate guard requirements across function boundaries; signals: if the patch adds a check at callee entry, ensure callers either invoke the patched callee or perform the same check before invoking pre-patch equivalents; mapping: the root cause can manifest at callers that rely on unchecked callees; FP mitigation: stop propagation when callee is already the patched function or when a wrapper guarantees the precondition.
7) Step 7: Objective: Account for dataflow from inputs to the sensitive operation; signals: variables used in the guard flow into the operation (parameters, fields, return values); mapping: missing validation of these flows is the exploit vector; FP mitigation: consider standard sanitizers (the same predicate or a stricter one) as satisfying the guard.
8) Step 8: Objective: Detect newly-added error handling around a risky API; signals: patch adds return-value checks, bounds adjustments, or error-paths before proceeding; mapping: previously unchecked error/size/permission allowed unsafe continuation; FP mitigation: only flag when the API return value influences safety of the subsequent sensitive operation.
9) Step 9: Objective: Handle aliasing of the guarded subject; signals: the variable or object validated by the guard may be accessed via aliases when performing the operation; mapping: guarding the subject is the mitigation; FP mitigation: require alias resolution that ties the guard target to the sink’s operand(s).
10) Step 10: Objective: Exclude cases where the guard is enforced by an enclosing context; signals: surrounding higher-level guard dominating both the check and the sink, or function-level invariants enforced unconditionally at entry; mapping: these contexts satisfy the root-cause mitigation; FP mitigation: require dominance/post-dominance evidence that the contextual guard truly governs all paths.
11) Step 11: Objective: Identify path segments where the guard can be invalidated before the sink; signals: state-changing calls or assignments that break the predicate after it’s checked; mapping: invalidation recreates the original weakness; FP mitigation: only flag when the invalidation is feasible and not revalidated before the sink.
12) Step 12: Objective: Prioritize findings that match the exact patch sites; signals: same file/function/region where the patch added the guard; mapping: these are most likely true positives of the same class; FP mitigation: downgrade findings in unrelated modules unless they match a high-confidence equivalence of guard and sink.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and method bodies where the patch introduced new conditionals or early returns.
- Call sites to sensitive operations that became guarded by the patch.
- Condition checks and boolean-returning helper functions used as guards.
- Function boundaries where preconditions are enforced (entry checks) or assumed.
- Function return-value uses and subsequent control-flow (error paths, bounds adjustments).
- Allocation/access sites and state-changing calls between guard and sink.
- Lock or state precondition boundaries if the guard encodes such a requirement.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track data from inputs used in guard predicates to the operands of the sensitive operation to confirm the guard is relevant to the sink.
- Treat the guard predicate (and equivalent sanitizers) as a sanitizer node that must dominate the sink along all paths.
- Propagate required guard across wrappers/callees when parameters/returns carry the guarded value.
- Model invalidation edges where assignments or calls can break the previously-checked condition before the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippet where a sensitive operation is executed without the newly-added guard (e.g., operation executes without a preceding condition/early-return introduced by the patch).
- Negative: Post-patch snippet where the guard precedes and dominates the sensitive operation, including equivalent guard via a helper function.
- Test harness notes: Include cases with multiple paths (guarded and unguarded), aliasing of the guarded subject, and a wrapper function that either propagates or enforces the guard.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: Requires control-flow dominance analysis, basic aliasing, and simple interprocedural propagation of guard semantics.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent guards written differently (mitigate by normalizing logical equivalences and recognizing helper-based checks).
- Infeasible paths due to external invariants (mitigate by requiring dominance and basic path feasibility).
- Contextual guards enforced at higher levels (mitigate by detecting enclosing conditions that dominate the sink).
- Refactoring-only patches mistaken as new guards (mitigate by focusing on changes that alter reachability, not just code motion).

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No details are available in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; the plan assumes the patch introduces a guard/validation around a sensitive operation.
- The exact language, APIs, and semantics of the “guard” and “sensitive operation” are unknown; the checker is specified at a conceptual level.
- The root cause type (e.g., bounds, null, permission, state) is unspecified; equivalence detection must be conservative.
- External specifications/contracts that declare preconditions are not provided; the checker cannot rely on them.
