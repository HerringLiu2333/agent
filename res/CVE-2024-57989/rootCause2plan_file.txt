1. Plan Summary
Detect unchecked devm_kzalloc allocations whose returned pointers are dereferenced without a dominating NULL check, as in mt7925_change_vif_links before the fix for CVE-2024-57989.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify calls to devm_kzalloc and capture the assigned variables at each call site (e.g., mconf, mlink) in functions in drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7925/main.c. This targets the allocator noted in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; reduce false positives by focusing on devm_kzalloc specifically.
2) Step 2: For each allocated variable, find subsequent member access or pointer dereference operations (e.g., mconf->link_id, mlink->wcid.link_id). This maps to the unguarded dereferences described in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; exclude uses that occur only after a proven NULL check.
3) Step 3: Determine if there exists a NULL-check guarding the allocated pointer before its first dereference on all paths (e.g., if (!ptr) return ... or combined checks if (!a || !b)). This corresponds to the fix in [PATCH_DIFF]; suppress alerts when a dominating check exists that returns or jumps to an error path.
4) Step 4: Handle multiple allocations in the same block: if two pointers are allocated (e.g., mconf and mlink), verify each pointer is explicitly checked before any dereference of that specific pointer. This addresses the case highlighted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] where both were unchecked; avoid false positives if a combined check covers all dereferences (e.g., if (!mconf || !mlink) return -ENOMEM).
5) Step 5: Apply path-sensitive control-flow analysis across conditional branches (e.g., if (!old_links) else), ensuring the dereference is matched to the branch where the pointer was allocated. This mirrors the pattern in [FILE_CONTENT] where dereferences follow allocations in the else branch; reduce false positives by not flagging the path that assigns a non-allocated safe pointer (&mvif->bss_conf).
6) Step 6: Within loops (e.g., for_each_set_bit over link_id), ensure checks consider per-iteration allocation and usage so that dereferences in the same iteration are guarded. This aligns with loop-based allocation seen in [FILE_CONTENT]; avoid misattributing checks across iterations.
7) Step 7: Treat early error handling patterns as valid guards (e.g., return -ENOMEM directly after NULL check) and confirm they dominate all dereferences. This reflects the fix added in [PATCH_DIFF]; suppress warnings when the error path clearly prevents subsequent use.
8) Step 8: Flag cases where the allocated pointer participates in assignments followed by field writes (e.g., setting link_id, assigning to vif fields) without intervening checks, indicating immediate dereference risk. This maps directly to the crash mechanism described in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; reduce false positives by ignoring mere storage without dereference.
9) Step 9: Optionally, rank findings higher when allocations use GFP_KERNEL (as in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FILE_CONTENT]), since they are more likely to fail under memory pressure, but do not rely on this to flag. This helps prioritize DoS-relevant paths while still catching cases regardless of flags.

3. Target Elements
- Function bodies containing devm_kzalloc calls (e.g., mt7925_change_vif_links).
- Allocation call sites and the variables assigned to their results.
- Conditional branches surrounding allocations (e.g., if (!old_links) else).
- Pointer dereferences and member accesses on allocated variables.
- NULL checks and error handling constructs (returns/gotos).
- Loops over link additions where allocations are per-iteration (for_each_set_bit).
- Return statements and error codes indicating guarded failure handling (e.g., -ENOMEM).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from the result of devm_kzalloc to its first dereference (member access, function call requiring non-null).
- Require that no dominating NULL-check on the variable (or combined variables) prevents reaching the dereference on any path within the function/block.
- Maintain path sensitivity: associate dereferences with the branch that performed the allocation and the current loop iteration.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch pattern in mt7925_change_vif_links where mconf = devm_kzalloc(...); mlink = devm_kzalloc(...); followed by mconf->link_id = link_id; mlink->wcid.link_id = link_id without any NULL checks; expect a detection.
- Negative: Patched version adding if (!mconf || !mlink) return -ENOMEM; before any dereference; expect no detection.
- Negative: A function where devm_kzalloc is followed by if (!ptr) { goto err; } and all dereferences occur after the guard or on paths where ptr is known non-null; expect no detection.
- Test harness notes: Run on the provided mt7925/main.c and ensure only the pre-patch variant of mt7925_change_vif_links is flagged, with no alerts on mt7925_mac_sta_add_links (which already checks !mlink) or the patched code.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High: kernel allocator misuse leading to NULL deref and DoS is impactful and the analysis requires path-sensitive guard-dominance checking.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Allocations immediately replaced by safe non-NULL pointers on certain paths; mitigate via branch-correlated dataflow tracking.
- Implicit non-null guarantees via wrappers or annotations not visible; mitigate by focusing on devm_kzalloc which is known to return NULL (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Checks performed outside the local block or via helper macros; mitigate by requiring a dominating guard prior to first dereference, not just any later check.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The checker focuses on devm_kzalloc; other allocators are not covered unless explicitly added (only devm_kzalloc is evidenced in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Concurrency/lock handling on early returns is not analyzed (as noted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- The checker assumes that member access implies dereference requiring non-null; deeper semantic contracts of callee functions are not inferred from the provided materials.
