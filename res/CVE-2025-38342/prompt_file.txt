1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38342

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect bounds check

3. Root Cause Summary
software_node_get_reference_args() validated only that index*sizeof(*ref) < prop->length, which guarantees the start of the index-th element is within the buffer but not that the entire element fits. For malformed DEV_PROP_REF properties whose length is not a multiple of sizeof(*ref), this allows selecting an index where (index+1)*sizeof(*ref) exceeds prop->length, causing reads past the end of the property buffer. The patch tightens the check to require the full element be present: ((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length) -> -ENOENT.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Firmware node (fwnode) framework — software nodes implementation

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In software_node_get_reference_args(), the OOB guard was: if (index * sizeof(*ref) >= prop->length) return -ENOENT;. This did not ensure that the complete software_node_ref_args element at position index was fully contained within the property data, permitting partial/overrun access when prop->length was not aligned to element size.

3) Trigger Condition:
- The property entry is of type DEV_PROP_REF and stored out-of-line (prop->is_inline == false).
- prop->length is not a multiple of sizeof(struct software_node_ref_args).
- Caller requests an index such that index * sizeof(*ref) < prop->length but (index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length (e.g., last “partial” element).

4) Impact Mechanism:
- The code computes ref = &ref_array[index] and then reads ref->node and ref->args[i], which may read beyond the allocated buffer.
- Subsequent use of ref->node (e.g., property_entry_read_int_array(ref->node->properties, ...) when nargs_prop is set) can dereference an invalid pointer, leading to kernel crash; even without dereference, copying ref->args leaks adjacent memory contents into args->args.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Strengthen bounds checking to require that the entire index-th element is present in the buffer by verifying the end offset does not exceed prop->length.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replaced the flawed check:
  - Old: if (index * sizeof(*ref) >= prop->length) return -ENOENT;
  - New: if ((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length) return -ENOENT;
This ensures the full struct software_node_ref_args at index is within bounds.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is purely a bounds-check correction; no locking or ordering semantics were modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This issue exemplifies a common kernel pitfall where array bounds are tracked in bytes but indexed in elements; checks must ensure complete element coverage, not just valid start offsets. Similar patterns across property parsing and firmware interfaces should be audited for alignment/length mismatches to prevent OOB reads that can cause crashes or data exposure. The fix improves robustness against malformed or adversarial property data provided via software nodes.
