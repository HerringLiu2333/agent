1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58020

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to unchecked memory allocation failure (improper error handling)

3. Root Cause Summary
mt_input_configured() assigns hi->input->name using devm_kasprintf() when a suffix is set but fails to check for a NULL return on allocation failure. This allows hi->input->name to become NULL, which is later dereferenced by the input/HID core paths, triggering a kernel NULL pointer dereference. The patch adds the missing NULL check and returns -ENOMEM on failure, preventing propagation of a NULL name.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
HID subsystem, multitouch driver (drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In mt_input_configured(), the call hi->input->name = devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s %s", hdev->name, suffix); is not followed by a check for a NULL return value. As a result, on allocation failure, hi->input->name is set to NULL without error handling.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Execution path where suffix is set (e.g., HID_VD_ASUS_CUSTOM_MEDIA_KEYS or default “UNKNOWN”).
- devm_kasprintf() fails (e.g., memory pressure), returning NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The input device name pointer (hi->input->name) becomes NULL and is later dereferenced by the input/HID core or user-space exposure paths, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference and system crash/DoS.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add a NULL check after devm_kasprintf() and return -ENOMEM if allocation fails, ensuring hi->input->name is never left NULL in the configured path.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Pre-patch: 
  if (suffix)
      hi->input->name = devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s %s", hdev->name, suffix);
- Post-patch: 
  if (suffix) {
      hi->input->name = devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s %s", hdev->name, suffix);
      if (!hi->input->name)
          return -ENOMEM;
  }
This change is confined to mt_input_configured() in drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c as shown in the diff hunk.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes; the fix is purely an error-path check for allocation failure.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Properly handling allocation failures in device initialization paths prevents kernel crashes triggered by low-memory conditions and untrusted device inputs. This bolsters robustness against denial-of-service scenarios where a malicious or malformed HID device (or memory pressure) could cause system instability via unchecked NULL pointers.
