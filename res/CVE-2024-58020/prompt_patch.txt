1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58020

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to unchecked allocation failure (denial-of-service)

3. Root Cause Summary
mt_input_configured() in drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c assigns hi->input->name using devm_kasprintf() when a suffix is present but does not check for a NULL return on allocation failure. The function then returns success, leaving hi->input->name potentially NULL. Subsequent code paths that assume a valid input device name dereference this NULL pointer, causing a kernel crash.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
HID multitouch driver (drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c), function mt_input_configured()

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Within the conditional “if (suffix)”, the code performed:
hi->input->name = devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s %s", hdev->name, suffix);
without verifying the returned pointer, failing to handle devm_kasprintf() returning NULL on memory allocation failure.

3) Trigger Condition:
- suffix is non-NULL, so the name construction path is taken.
- devm_kasprintf() fails due to memory pressure or allocation failure and returns NULL.
- mt_input_configured() returns 0, leaving hi->input->name as NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
A later dereference of hi->input->name (e.g., during input device registration or logging) accesses a NULL pointer, resulting in a kernel NULL pointer dereference and system crash/oops.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add a NULL pointer check immediately after devm_kasprintf() and propagate the failure by returning -ENOMEM, preventing subsequent use of a NULL name.

2) Key Code Changes:
- The “if (suffix)” block was expanded with braces.
- Inserted:
if (!hi->input->name)
    return -ENOMEM;
directly after the devm_kasprintf() assignment to hi->input->name.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch only adds an allocation failure check and an early return; no locking or ordering changes.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Unchecked results from managed allocation helpers like devm_kasprintf() can turn benign allocation failures into kernel crashes. Ensuring all such allocations are validated improves robustness under low-memory conditions and mitigates denial-of-service vectors. Similar patterns across HID/input and other drivers should be audited to prevent NULL dereferences from allocation failures.
