1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58020

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to missing allocation failure handling

3. Root Cause Summary
mt_input_configured() assigns hi->input->name using devm_kasprintf() when a suffix is set but does not check for a NULL return on allocation failure. This can leave hi->input->name as NULL, and subsequent kernel code that dereferences the input device name triggers a NULL pointer dereference. The flaw was introduced by commit 479439463529 (“HID: multitouch: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name”), which changed how the name is allocated but did not add a failure check.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
HID subsystem, multitouch driver (drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c), input device configuration path

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In mt_input_configured(), the code unconditionally assigns the result of devm_kasprintf() to hi->input->name when suffix is non-NULL:
“hi->input->name = devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s %s", hdev->name, suffix);”
No NULL check follows to detect allocation failure.

3) Trigger Condition:
- The function runs for HID inputs where a suffix is set (e.g., HID_VD_ASUS_CUSTOM_MEDIA_KEYS or default “UNKNOWN” path).
- devm_kasprintf() fails (e.g., under memory pressure), returning NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The input device’s name pointer remains NULL, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference later in the input/HID stack when the name is accessed, causing a kernel crash (DoS).

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Defensive programming: check the return value of devm_kasprintf() and propagate an error (-ENOMEM) if the allocation fails.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Wrapped the suffix assignment block with braces and added:
  “if (!hi->input->name) return -ENOMEM;”
- This ensures mt_input_configured() fails early on allocation failure, preventing the NULL name from propagating.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is localized to allocation error handling with no modifications to locking or concurrent access patterns.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
The fix strengthens robustness under memory pressure by preventing kernel crashes from unhandled allocation failures, improving system stability and resilience against denial-of-service conditions. It highlights the need for consistent error checking of devm_* and kasprintf-like helpers throughout drivers, reducing similar NULL deref risks across the kernel.
