1. Plan Summary
Generic taint-driven detection template to flag flows of untrusted/external input reaching security-sensitive operations without validation, to be specialized once CVE-2024-58070 details (sinks/sanitizers/functions) are known.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify untrusted sources — look for APIs that read data from external boundaries (network/HTTP request parameters, CLI args, environment variables, file inputs, IPC). Conceptual signals: framework-specific request/param getters, stdin readers, env lookups, file reads in input paths.

2) Step 2: Identify candidate sensitive sinks — enumerate operations that change security state or execute/interpret data (command execution, SQL construction/execution, deserialization, eval/template rendering, filesystem writes to sensitive paths, auth/permission checks). Conceptual signals: API calls that execute commands/queries, parse/deserialize untrusted formats, write configs, or perform policy decisions.

3) Step 3: Build dataflow from sources to sinks — track propagation through variables, fields, parameters, returns, and collections. Conceptual signals: assignments, function/method calls passing source-tainted values, object property sets, and returns that carry taint.

4) Step 4: Detect absence of validation/sanitization — require that flows do not pass through known sanitizers/validators (escaping, whitelisting, schema validation, canonicalization). Conceptual signals: calls to recognized validate/sanitize/normalize functions or checks that restrict content (e.g., fixed allowlists, strict type/format checks).

5) Step 5: Model implicit sanitization barriers — treat transformations that structurally prevent exploitation (e.g., parameterized queries, safe command APIs, safe serializers) as sanitizers. Conceptual signals: use of safe APIs (prepared statements, non-shell command invocations, sandboxed deserializers) on tainted data.

6) Step 6: Scope to project-relevant modules — allow configuration to restrict analysis to components suspected by the CVE once identified (e.g., particular files/functions/subsystems). Conceptual signals: package/module path filters, function/class names from patch metadata when available.

7) Step 7: Report only feasible, unsanitized flows — emit findings where tainted source reaches a sensitive sink without passing through any sanitizer/validator, and include the path for triage. Conceptual signals: end-to-end dataflow path summary showing source, propagation steps, and sink.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FUNCTION_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS details are available; the exact vulnerability class, affected functions, and concrete sinks/sanitizers cannot be determined.
- Sensitive sink categories and sanitizer lists must be tailored once CVE-2024-58070 specifics are known; current plan is a generic template.
- Framework/language-specific APIs for sources/sinks are unknown; the checker requires environment-specific configuration to be precise.
- Without patch context, scoping to the exact vulnerable code paths is not possible; results may be broad until refined with CVE details.
