1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence provided to derive the specific vulnerability pattern for CVE-2024-58070; this plan outlines a conservative, repeatable approach to extract the fix pattern from a patch and detect pre-patch flaws once [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[FILE_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Establish scope — locate files/functions changed by the security fix in [PATCH_DIFF]; signals: added/modified conditionals, API substitutions, error checks, capability/lock checks; FP mitigation: restrict to hunks labeled as security fix per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] if available.
2) Step 2: Identify guarded sinks — find operations newly wrapped by checks (e.g., dereferences, array accesses, privilege-sensitive calls, serialization/parsing); rationale: the root cause often is missing guards; FP mitigation: only consider operations directly touched in the patch.
3) Step 3: Extract the guard predicate pattern — model the exact preconditions introduced (null/length/range/state/authorization/lock/return-value checks); rationale: the fix defines the necessary safety contract; FP mitigation: normalize to semantic equivalence (e.g., != NULL vs pointer truthiness) to avoid superficial mismatches.
4) Step 4: Derive the source context — determine inputs influencing the guarded sink (parameters, external data, return values); rationale: unvalidated or unchecked dataflow to the sink is the hazard; FP mitigation: require reachability of the sink from functions changed in the patch or their callers.
5) Step 5: Define violation pattern — report sink usages reachable from similar contexts that lack the extracted guard immediately dominating the sink; rationale: mirrors the pre-patch flaw; FP mitigation: require dominance/post-dominance relationship for the check to be considered present/absent.
6) Step 6: Model alternative safe APIs — if [PATCH_DIFF] replaces an unsafe API with a safer one (e.g., length-checked variant), flag uses of the old API not protected by equivalent checks; FP mitigation: whitelist call sites already performing equivalent validations.
7) Step 7: Validate error-handling — if the patch adds return-value checks, detect call sites ignoring or mishandling the return value leading to unsafe follow-up use; FP mitigation: ignore cases where the return value is provably constant-safe or already validated upstream.
8) Step 8: Concurrency/state correctness — if the patch adds locking or state checks, detect accesses to the same shared resource without the lock/state precondition; FP mitigation: require same resource identity and consistent lock object/state variable as in the patch.
9) Step 9: Propagate patterns interprocedurally — if the patched function enforces new preconditions on its callers, detect callers that do not meet them; FP mitigation: constrain to call graph slices that include the patched entry points.
10) Step 10: Exclude non-functional changes — ignore cosmetic diffs (formatting, comments) and refactors unrelated to checks; FP mitigation: only derive patterns from semantic changes (AST: conditionals, API names, constants).
11) Step 11: Rank findings — prioritize sites most structurally similar to the patched hunk (same API, same argument positions, same data sources); FP mitigation: down-rank distant analogs to reduce noise.
12) Step 12: Cross-check with [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] — when available, ensure the inferred guard matches the stated root cause to avoid overgeneralization; FP mitigation: if mismatch, narrow to the exact fix motif.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch and their callers.
- Call sites to APIs wrapped or replaced in the patch.
- Condition checks introduced by the patch (null/range/return-value/feature flag/authorization).
- Allocation sites and dereferences near patched regions.
- Lock/unlock boundaries and state predicates added by the patch.
- Function return-value uses added or validated in the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track data from function parameters, external inputs, or return values into the guarded sink operations identified in the patch.
- Model guard predicates as sanitizers/preconditions; a violation is flow into the sink without passing through an equivalent guard dominating the sink.
- For API replacement fixes, treat calls to the unsafe API as sinks and the presence of the safer API or validated arguments as sanitization.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippet mirroring the patched code path but lacking the newly added check (e.g., call/dereference without the specific guard), expected to be flagged.
- Negative: Post-patch snippet with the guard in place and equivalent semantic variants (e.g., reordered but dominating checks), expected not to be flagged.
- Test harness notes: Construct minimal examples around the exact APIs/conditions seen in [PATCH_DIFF]; include interprocedural caller-callee cases and alternative but equivalent guard forms.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — the absence of [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [FILE_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] prevents defining the concrete vulnerability pattern; effort is needed to parameterize the checker once evidence is available.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically equivalent guards expressed differently: mitigate via dominance and predicate normalization.
- Contexts where the sink is safe by construction (constants, proven ranges): mitigate via lightweight value-range/nullability analysis.
- Refactor-induced diffs unrelated to security: mitigate by focusing only on security-relevant semantic changes from the patch.
- Overgeneralizing from one function to unrelated ones: mitigate by constraining to APIs/resources directly present in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the vulnerability class and concrete signals are unknown.
- Assumes the fix involves adding explicit guards, safer APIs, or state/lock checks; if the root cause is of a different nature (e.g., cryptographic, protocol, or configuration), this plan must be revised.
- Cannot specify exact sinks, guard predicates, or data sources without the missing materials; the checker must be parameterized once those are available.
