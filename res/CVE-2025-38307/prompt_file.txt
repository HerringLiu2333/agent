1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38307

2. Vulnerability Type
Null pointer dereference due to missing length validation (unsafe array indexing from parsed user input)

3. Root Cause Summary
trace_control_write() accessed array[1] immediately after parsing user-provided integers without verifying that the parsed length (array[0]) was non-zero. When parse_int_array_user() returned an array whose first element (the count) was 0, dereferencing array[1] performed an out-of-bounds access that could lead to a null-pointer dereference and kernel crash.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
ASoC (ALSA SoC) Intel AVS driver debugfs control path (trace_control)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In trace_control_write(), after parsing input, the code did: “num_elems = *array; resource_mask = array[1];” without checking that num_elems > 0. This assumes at least one additional element exists, which is not guaranteed per parse_int_array_user() semantics where array[0] carries the length and can be 0.

3) Trigger Condition:
A write to the debugfs file “trace_control” with content that parse_int_array_user() interprets as an integer array whose first element (length) is 0. This causes the function to index beyond the sole valid element at array[0].

4) Impact Mechanism:
Accessing array[1] when num_elems == 0 results in an out-of-bounds read leading to a null-pointer dereference in kernel space, causing an oops and denial of service. Subsequent logic (e.g., computing hweight_long(resource_mask) and potentially referencing &array[2]) further relies on the invalid resource_mask derived from the out-of-bounds read, exacerbating the fault.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce explicit validation that the parsed length is non-zero before any access beyond array[0], and return -EINVAL if the array is empty.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added:
  “if (!num_elems) { ret = -EINVAL; goto free_array; }”
- Deferred “resource_mask = array[1];” until after the non-zero length check.
These changes are confined to trace_control_write().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch only adds input validation and reorders a single assignment; no locking primitives or concurrency assumptions were modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
User-controllable debugfs input must be robustly validated, especially when using parsers like parse_int_array_user() that encode array length at index 0. Access beyond the length element must be guarded against zero-length arrays to prevent kernel crashes. Similar array-based interfaces should audit for and enforce non-zero lengths before indexing past array[0], reducing the risk of kernel oops from malformed inputs.
