1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58086

2. Vulnerability Type
Use-after-free / stale pointer due to improper resource teardown

3. Root Cause Summary
In v3d_perfmon_destroy_ioctl, destroying a perfmon did not check whether it was the currently active perfmon (v3d->active_perfmon) and did not stop it before releasing its reference. As a result, v3d->active_perfmon could continue to point to a perfmon object that had been put/freed, leaving a dangling pointer and inconsistent device state. Subsequent code paths that consult or dereference v3d->active_perfmon could then access freed memory or operate on invalid hardware state.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
DRM Broadcom V3D GPU driver (drivers/gpu/drm/v3d), performance monitor handling.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
v3d_perfmon_destroy_ioctl performed v3d_perfmon_put(perfmon) without first stopping the perfmon if it was active, and without clearing v3d->active_perfmon. This omission left v3d->active_perfmon pointing to an object whose lifetime had ended.

3) Trigger Condition:
Userspace issues the perfmon destroy IOCTL (v3d_perfmon_destroy_ioctl) targeting the perfmon that is currently active (perfmon == v3d->active_perfmon).

4) Impact Mechanism:
- v3d->active_perfmon becomes a stale/dangling pointer after the destroy path releases the object, enabling use-after-free when later code accesses or dereferences v3d->active_perfmon.
- The hardware perf monitor may continue running after its software object is destroyed, causing undefined behavior and instability.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Ensure proper teardown ordering: detect when the perfmon being destroyed is the active one and explicitly stop it before releasing its reference. This guarantees that device state is quiesced and v3d->active_perfmon is cleared in a controlled manner before the object is put/freed.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added retrieval of v3d device: struct v3d_dev *v3d = v3d_priv->v3d;
- Inserted conditional stop before put:
  if (perfmon == v3d->active_perfmon)
      v3d_perfmon_stop(v3d, perfmon, false);
- Retained the subsequent v3d_perfmon_put(perfmon).
These changes occur inside v3d_perfmon_destroy_ioctl under the existing perfmon.lock.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
The stop operation is now performed while holding v3d_priv->perfmon.lock, closing a race window where active_perfmon could become dangling between destroy and later accesses. The patch does not introduce new locks but enforces correct ordering (stop-before-put) under the existing mutex, improving atomicity of state transition for active_perfmon.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
The bug highlights the importance of consistent resource lifecycle management in IOCTL destroy paths, especially for “active” objects referenced globally (like v3d->active_perfmon). Ensuring stop/disable before release prevents stale pointers and UAF conditions that are common in driver subsystems. Similar patterns should be audited across DRM and other drivers: any global/activity pointer must be reset or quiesced prior to object destruction under appropriate locking to avoid memory safety and device state corruption.
