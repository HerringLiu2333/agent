1. Plan Summary
Detect destructor/teardown paths that free or drop the last reference to an object while a device-global “active” pointer may still reference that same object, without first stopping/clearing the active state, leading to a dangling pointer and potential use-after-free (based on ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS and PATCH_DESCRIPTION).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify destructor-like functions that remove an object from a per-file registry and then release it. Signals: a function that calls idr_remove(...) to obtain an object and subsequently calls a release/drop routine (e.g., v3d_perfmon_put) as shown in FUNCTION_CONTENT; mitigate FPs by restricting to functions with “destroy” semantics (name contains destroy_ioctl) as in PATCH_DIFF.
2) Step 2: Track the removed object pointer through the function to the release call to confirm it is the same entity being freed/dereferenced. Signals: single variable assigned from idr_remove and later passed to v3d_perfmon_put (FUNCTION_CONTENT); mitigate FPs by requiring a straightforward flow without aliasing or reassignment.
3) Step 3: Resolve the associated device/global context to which an “active” pointer could belong. Signals: retrieve device pointer via file_priv->driver_priv->v3d (added in PATCH_DIFF) and recognize the device-global field v3d->active_perfmon (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, PATCH_DIFF); mitigate FPs by requiring both the device pointer and active field to be available in the same translation unit or accessible headers.
4) Step 4: Check whether the destructor tests if the object being destroyed is currently the active one. Signals: presence/absence of a comparison “obj == dev->active_perfmon” (added in PATCH_DIFF); mitigate FPs by accepting semantically equivalent checks that determine activeness for this exact device-global field.
5) Step 5: Check whether the destructor proactively stops the active object before releasing it. Signals: a call to a stop routine taking the device and the object (v3d_perfmon_stop(dev, obj, ...), as in PATCH_DIFF) before the release call; mitigate FPs by allowing variants that clear the active pointer and stop monitoring through a recognized stop/disable routine in the same module.
6) Step 6: Verify correct ordering: stop must occur before put/free. Signals: call ordering where stop precedes v3d_perfmon_put (PATCH_DIFF, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS); mitigate FPs by not flagging if stop is guaranteed to run on the same object on all paths before put.
7) Step 7: Flag the pattern where put/free occurs without any prior stop/clear despite the module maintaining a device-global active pointer of the same type. Signals: absence of any writes to dev->active_perfmon and absence of a stop call prior to v3d_perfmon_put (FUNCTION_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS); mitigate FPs by ensuring a null-check path is respected (if (!obj) return) and only analyzing the valid-object path.
8) Step 8: Correlate the object type with the active field’s type to confirm a plausible alias. Signals: both are struct v3d_perfmon (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, PATCH_DIFF); mitigate FPs by requiring type compatibility or a clear conceptual match (same struct name) between the object and the active field.
9) Step 9: Strengthen confidence by detecting the presence of a known stop API in the module that is not invoked on this path. Signals: existence of v3d_perfmon_stop in the same file (PATCH_DIFF) and its non-use prior to put in the suspect destructor; mitigate FPs by downgrading severity if no stop routine is available to call.

3. Target Elements
- Functions with destroy/teardown semantics, especially IOCTL handlers.
- Call sites of idr_remove that return an object later passed to a put/free function.
- Device/context pointer derivations from file_priv->driver_priv->v3d.
- Device-global “active” fields (e.g., v3d->active_perfmon) in the same module.
- Calls to stop/disable routines (e.g., v3d_perfmon_stop) and release/drop routines (e.g., v3d_perfmon_put).
- Control-flow/ordering between active checks, stop calls, and put/free.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the object pointer from idr_remove through local variables to the release call to ensure identity.
- Model potential alias with the device-global active pointer by matching types and the dev->active_* field access.
- Ensure the analysis path excludes the null-return path and focuses on the valid-object branch that leads to put/free.
- Sequence/ordering dataflow: confirm stop (if present) occurs before put/free on the same object.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch v3d_perfmon_destroy_ioctl (FUNCTION_CONTENT) that removes an object and calls v3d_perfmon_put without checking v3d->active_perfmon or calling v3d_perfmon_stop (expect a finding).
- Negative: Patched version (PATCH_DIFF) that compares perfmon to v3d->active_perfmon and calls v3d_perfmon_stop before v3d_perfmon_put (expect no finding).
- Test harness notes: Run on the v3d_perfmon.c file around the destroy ioctl and confirm the checker’s sensitivity to the added conditional and stop call ordering.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium effort; high priority due to use-after-free risk highlighted in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- put/free function internally clears the active pointer: mitigate by heuristically checking for writes to dev->active_perfmon in the same function or nearby helper, and downgrade severity if detected.
- Alternate teardown paths elsewhere stop/clear activeness before this destructor: mitigate by scanning the current function for any stop/clear calls and requiring their presence on all paths to put/free.
- Modules without a stop API: mitigate by lowering confidence unless an obvious equivalent clear/disable is present.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes availability of device pointer and active field in analysis scope (PATCH_DIFF references dev->active_perfmon but actual struct definitions are not provided).
- Cannot prove that v3d_perfmon_put does not internally stop/clear activeness due to missing implementation details (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS notes unknown internal locking/behavior).
- Assumes idr_remove + put/free represents the last reference drop leading to potential free, as inferred from FUNCTION_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
