1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38294

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference leading to kernel crash/denial-of-service

3. Root Cause Summary
The error path in ath12k_mac_op_assign_vif_chanctx dereferenced a NULL radio handle via arvif->ar->ab when ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev() failed and returned NULL. The code attempted to emit a warning using ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, …) despite the radio handle not being established in the failure scenario. This missing NULL validation in the logging path caused a NULL pointer dereference.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Qualcomm ath12k Wi-Fi driver (mac80211 operations)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In ath12k_mac_op_assign_vif_chanctx, when ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(hw, arvif, ctx) returned NULL, the code logged using ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, …), dereferencing arvif->ar despite the failed assignment. Pre-patch snippet: “ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, "failed to assign chanctx for vif %pM link id %u link vif is already started", …);”.

3) Trigger Condition:
ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev() fails (returns NULL), for example when “link vif is already started” as indicated by the log message, leading the subsequent error logging to access arvif->ar->ab.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Dereferencing arvif->ar when it is NULL causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops and potential system crash, enabling denial-of-service via a problematic channel context assignment operation.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Redirect error logging to a helper that does not rely on the radio handle, avoiding NULL dereferences in the failure path. Specifically replace ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, …) with ath12k_hw_warn(ah, …), where ah remains valid regardless of the assignment outcome.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Before: ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, "failed to assign chanctx for vif %pM link id %u link vif is already started", vif->addr, link_id);
- After: ath12k_hw_warn(ah, "failed to assign chanctx for vif %pM link id %u link vif is already started", vif->addr, link_id);
This change occurs in ath12k_mac_op_assign_vif_chanctx around the NULL-check branch for the return of ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
Unknown/Not determinable. The patch does not introduce or modify locking; it strictly changes the logging helper to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix removes a straightforward kernel crash vector triggered by driver error paths, improving robustness against denial-of-service conditions caused by malformed or unexpected Wi-Fi interface/channel context operations. Ensuring that error handling does not dereference invalid pointers is critical in drivers exposed to complex state transitions initiated by user space (mac80211/cfg80211) or firmware interactions. The change exemplifies safer logging practices that avoid relying on objects that may be NULL after failed setup paths.
