1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58058

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference leading to denial-of-service (kernel crash)

3. Root Cause Summary
The function ubifs_dump_tnc() in fs/ubifs/debug.c unconditionally dereferenced the pointer returned by ubifs_tnc_levelorder_next() and accessed znode->level without validating that the in-memory TNC root (c->zroot.znode) or the returned znode was non-NULL. If the TNC tree was empty (c->zroot.znode == NULL) or no node was returned, this resulted in a NULL dereference and kernel crash when dumping the TNC.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
UBIFS debugging utilities (fs/ubifs/debug.c), specifically the TNC (Tree Node Cache) dump facility.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In ubifs_dump_tnc(), the code started with:
“znode = ubifs_tnc_levelorder_next(c, c->zroot.znode, NULL);
 level = znode->level;”
There was no check to ensure c->zroot.znode or znode was valid before accessing znode->level, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when the TNC tree was empty.

3) Trigger Condition:
Invoking the TNC dump via debugfs (dfs_file_write -> ubifs_dump_tnc()), while c->zroot.znode is NULL (e.g., empty TNC in memory), or ubifs_tnc_levelorder_next() immediately returns NULL. This can occur during certain mount states or when the index root has not been loaded into memory.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Dereferencing znode->level when znode is NULL causes a kernel oops/panic, resulting in a denial-of-service. Since this path is reachable via debugfs, a privileged user action can reliably trigger the crash.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce a guard to check if c->zroot.znode is non-NULL before performing level-order traversal and dereferencing znode. If the TNC tree is empty, print an informational message and avoid traversal.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added:
“if (c->zroot.znode) {
    znode = ubifs_tnc_levelorder_next(c, c->zroot.znode, NULL);
    level = znode->level;
    … while (znode) { … }
} else {
    pr_err("empty TNC tree in memory\n");
}”
This ensures traversal and dereferencing only occur when the root znode exists; otherwise, it logs that the tree is empty.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No changes to locking. The caller (dfs_file_write) already acquires c->tnc_mutex before calling ubifs_dump_tnc(). The patch solely adds a NULL check and does not alter lock ordering or introduce new synchronization, thereby not impacting concurrency semantics.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Debugging interfaces, especially those exposed via debugfs, must defensively validate internal state before accessing pointers to avoid kernel crashes from benign or user-triggered scenarios. This fix reduces the attack surface for denial-of-service via debug paths and highlights the need for systematic NULL checks in diagnostic utilities across the kernel.
