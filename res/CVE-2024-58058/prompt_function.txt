1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58058

2. Vulnerability Type
Logic error leading to infinite loop and RCU stall (Denial of Service)

3. Root Cause Summary
The ath11k driver’s RX monitor destination ring processing assumed that every buf_id from hardware maps to a valid buffer. When the driver could not obtain a valid buffer for a buf_id, the loop failed to make forward progress (e.g., breaking out of the inner path and then re-processing the same descriptor), resulting in an infinite loop within the destination processing. This livelock in an RCU context caused an RCU stall and eventual kernel crash.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
ath11k (Qualcomm 802.11ax Wi-Fi driver) data path RX monitor destination ring processing

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Invalid/unresolvable buf_id handling lacked a forward-progress path: upon encountering an invalid buf_id, the code did not properly skip/advance to the next MSDU, causing repeated processing of the same entry. Kernel logs show “msdu_pop: invalid buf_id” and “dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed,” indicating the driver repeatedly hits the same invalid buf_id without progressing.

3) Trigger Condition:
Hardware supplies a buf_id that does not correspond to any valid/allocated buffer; the driver cannot retrieve a buffer for that buf_id (as evidenced by logs: “data msdu_pop: invalid buf_id 309”).

4) Impact Mechanism:
The processing loop spins indefinitely on the same descriptor under RCU protection, stalling RCU and leading to a kernel crash/hang (RCU stall). This is a denial-of-service condition.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Ensure forward progress by skipping the problematic buf_id and reaping the next entry, replacing the prior break/early-exit behavior with “process next MSDU” logic so the loop advances.

2) Key Code Changes:
Unknown/Not determinable from the provided diff. The [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] states “Fix this by skipping the problematic buf_id and reaping the next entry, replacing the break with the next MSDU processing,” but the [PATCH_DIFF] provided shows unrelated changes in fs/ubifs/debug.c (adding a NULL check for c->zroot.znode in ubifs_dump_tnc), and no ath11k code is included.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
The change removes the livelock within an RCU read-side critical section by guaranteeing loop progress; this prevents RCU stall. No explicit locking/RCU API changes are described, only control-flow changes to ensure the loop advances to the next entry.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Hardware-facing ring-processing loops must guarantee forward progress even on malformed or unexpected inputs; otherwise they can induce livelocks in critical contexts such as RCU, causing system-wide stalls. Robust validation and skip/advance policies for identifiers (buf_id) are essential in drivers to avoid denial-of-service. This case underscores the importance of defensive handling of hardware anomalies and careful control-flow in hot-path loops.
