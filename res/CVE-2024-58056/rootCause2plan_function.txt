1. Plan Summary
Detect functions where a zero-initialized resource-index field is used by a release/destructor to free an ID when early-error cleanup can invoke the release before the index has been allocated, leading to invalid ida_free on an unallocated ID.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify allocator functions that create a struct via zero-initializing allocation (e.g., kzalloc) and set up a device member, with an error cleanup label that calls put_device on that device. Signals: a function allocates a struct with kzalloc, initializes device fields, and contains a goto to a label that calls put_device(&obj->dev); reduces FPs by requiring the allocated object to be the same one passed to put_device (same pointer).
2) Step 2: Find the corresponding release/destructor that is invoked by put_device and calls ida_free using a struct field guarded by a condition like field >= 0. Signals: a release function (e.g., rproc_type_release per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]) checks (obj->index >= 0) and then calls ida_free(obj->index); reduces FPs by requiring the exact field used in the condition to be the one passed to ida_free.
3) Step 3: Record the index field used by ida_free in the release function and confirm it is not explicitly initialized to a negative sentinel before any possible cleanup. Signals: absence of assignments like obj->index = -1 before cleanup; reduces FPs by excluding cases where a negative sentinel is set early, which would make the guard false.
4) Step 4: In the allocator function, locate the first assignment of the index field from ida_alloc and determine its program order relative to earlier operations that can fail and branch to cleanup. Signals: an assignment obj->index = ida_alloc(...), and earlier blocks with if-fail then goto put_device; reduces FPs by confirming ida_alloc happens after at least one failing operation.
5) Step 5: Model control flow paths to verify there exists a path from function entry through a failing operation to the cleanup label without passing through the ida_alloc assignment. Signals: a path where conditions on allocations or helper calls (e.g., kstrdup_const, rproc_alloc_firmware, rproc_alloc_ops per [FUNCTION_CONTENT]) can lead to goto put_device before ida_alloc; reduces FPs by requiring a feasible path, not merely syntactic ordering.
6) Step 6: Confirm the cleanup label directly calls put_device(&obj->dev), which triggers the release and thus the ida_free logic. Signals: the label block contains put_device on the same obj->dev; reduces FPs by matching the object identity from allocation to cleanup.
7) Step 7: Validate that the index field’s initial value on the early-error path is zero due to kzalloc, and no earlier assignment changes it. Signals: kzalloc used to allocate the struct and no writes to obj->index before ida_alloc; reduces FPs by excluding cases where the field is later set to a safe sentinel early.
8) Step 8: Check that the release guard is a non-strict “>= 0”, which will be true for zero-initialized fields, making ida_free reachable with an unallocated ID. Signals: predicate compares the field against 0 with >=; reduces FPs by excluding guards that require additional allocation flags or stricter conditions.
9) Step 9: Correlate the device type/class setup with the release path as described (device.type/class set and driver_data set to obj) to strengthen the likelihood that put_device reaches the intended release function. Signals: device_initialize and dev.type/class assignment present (per [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); reduces FPs by requiring standard device release wiring.
10) Step 10: Report when all conditions hold: zero-initialized struct, release frees based on index >= 0, ida_alloc of index occurs after earlier fail-prone operations, and cleanup can invoke release before allocation. Signals: conjunction of Steps 1–9; reduces FPs by demanding the full pattern consistent with [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] and [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].

3. Target Elements
- Allocator functions that:
  - Allocate and zero-initialize a struct (kzalloc).
  - Initialize a device within the struct (device_initialize, dev fields).
  - Have error paths with goto to a cleanup label that calls put_device.
- Release/destructor functions invoked by put_device that:
  - Check obj->index >= 0 (or similar) and call ida_free(obj->index).
- Field assignments to the index (ida_alloc) and any early sentinel writes.
- Conditional failures and goto cleanup edges before the ida_alloc assignment.
- Cross-function relationship between put_device and the specific release function.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the value of the index field from zero-initialization through assignments to detect whether it can be negative before cleanup.
- Path analysis from allocator entry to cleanup label to ensure the path bypasses ida_alloc.
- Cross-call link from put_device to the associated release function that uses the index field in ida_free.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch rproc_alloc where kstrdup_const or rproc_alloc_firmware failure leads to goto put_device, while ida_alloc of rproc->index occurs later; expect a report of potential invalid ida_free with index=0.
- Negative: Post-patch rproc_alloc where ida_alloc is moved earlier (immediately after idr_init), ensuring no cleanup path can reach put_device before setting rproc->index; expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Use function-level CFG/path exploration to simulate early failures and verify the presence/absence of the path that reaches cleanup before ida_alloc; confirm release uses index >= 0 and calls ida_free.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Release functions with additional allocation flags gating ida_free beyond index >= 0; mitigate by requiring the exact guard on the index field.
- Cases where the index is set to a negative sentinel early; mitigate by scanning for assignments before cleanup.
- Unclear linkage between put_device and the specific release function; mitigate by requiring device initialization patterns (type/class/driver_data) as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT].
- Error paths that are syntactically present but practically unreachable; mitigate by requiring multiple fail-prone calls (e.g., allocations) before ida_alloc as observed in [FUNCTION_CONTENT].

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The exact body of rproc_type_release is not shown; reliance on [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] stating it checks (rproc->index >= 0) and calls ida_free.
- The checker assumes put_device triggers the identified release function for the same object based on typical Linux device semantics; cross-function binding may be approximated.
- The approach is tailored to patterns similar to ida_alloc/ida_free with integer index semantics and may not generalize to other allocators without analogous guards.
