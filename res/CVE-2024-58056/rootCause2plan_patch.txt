1. Plan Summary
Detect kernel patterns where a release/cleanup function calls ida_free based on a non-negative sentinel check of a struct field, while error paths can trigger put_device (and thus the release) before ida_alloc assigns a valid ID, leading to freeing an unallocated ID.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify release functions that free an IDA index. Signals — Functions that call ida_free with a struct field under a guard like “field >= 0” (conceptual non-negative check). FP mitigation — Restrict to calls where the freed value is a member field (e.g., obj->index) and the guard references the same field.

2) Step 2: Objective — Extract the struct field used as the ID in the release path. Signals — Dataflow from the argument to ida_free back to a specific field of a concrete struct type used consistently within the release function. FP mitigation — Require consistent use of the same base object in both the guard and the free call.

3) Step 3: Objective — Find constructor/allocation functions that create/initialize the same object type and may call put_device on error. Signals — Functions that manipulate the same struct type, initialize members including .dev, and have an error path calling put_device(&obj->dev). FP mitigation — Ensure the obj in put_device is the same alias as the one whose field is freed in the release (field-sensitive aliasing).

4) Step 4: Objective — Determine ordering of ida_alloc assignment to the ID field relative to possible put_device calls. Signals — Assignment of field from ida_alloc return occurs after other operations that can branch/goto an error label leading to put_device. FP mitigation — Use control-flow reachability: report only if there exists a path to put_device that does not pass through any assignment of the ID field from ida_alloc.

5) Step 5: Objective — Confirm that the release path can be triggered from the allocation function’s error path. Signals — put_device on the same object implies .release callback may run (based on [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation — Restrict to device-like objects with a dev member and a known release function referencing the same struct type.

6) Step 6: Objective — Check whether the ID field has a safe sentinel initialization before any possible release. Signals — Look for explicit assignment of the field to a negative value (e.g., -1) prior to any operation that can lead to put_device; or alternately, an “allocated flag” that gates the free instead of a numeric sentinel. FP mitigation — Do not flag if such initialization dominates all error paths to put_device.

7) Step 7: Objective — Detect implicit zero-initialization risk. Signals — The object is allocated via zero-initializing allocators (e.g., kzalloc-like patterns) or is otherwise known to be zeroed so the field defaults to 0 (based on [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] note that rproc objects are zero-initialized). FP mitigation — Only flag when no prior explicit negative sentinel initialization exists and the allocator is likely zero-initializing, or the field is not otherwise initialized before potential release.

8) Step 8: Objective — Verify the free-side condition relies on non-negative sentinel semantics. Signals — The guard uses a comparison like “>= 0” on the ID field, consistent with IDA APIs where non-negative indicates a valid ID (based on [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation — Exclude cases where the guard uses a separate “is_allocated” boolean or checks membership against an allocator structure.

9) Step 9: Objective — Correlate allocator/free pair to IDA. Signals — The field is written from ida_alloc return on some path and later used in ida_free; or, per the issue pattern, the write occurs too late. FP mitigation — If no ida_alloc is present anywhere in the function or module for that field, deprioritize unless release still frees via ida_free.

10) Step 10: Objective — Reduce noise by requiring a concrete early failure site. Signals — Presence of operations before the ida_alloc assignment that can return error or branch to error handling (e.g., memory allocation of name, ops setup failures), which then call put_device (based on [PATCH_DIFF] reordering and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] examples). FP mitigation — Require at least one such operation with a clear error path to put_device dominating the pre-ida_alloc region.

3. Target Elements
- Functions implementing release/cleanup logic that call ida_free guarded by a non-negative check of a struct field.
- Allocation/constructor functions for device-like objects that manipulate a struct with a dev member and call put_device on error.
- Assignments of struct fields from ida_alloc return values.
- Error-handling control-flow edges (goto labels/returns) leading to put_device.
- Initializations to sentinel values (e.g., setting field to -1) or indications of zero-initialized allocations.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from ida_free’s argument to the struct field and its assignments within the program.
- Track control-flow paths from function entry to put_device that bypass any assignment from ida_alloc or negative-sentinel initialization to the field.
- Associate object aliases across the function to ensure the same struct instance is being analyzed on both allocation and release paths.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function allocates a zero-initialized struct, performs several operations that may fail and goto an error label calling put_device, and only later assigns field = ida_alloc; the release function frees with ida_free under “field >= 0.” Expect a report.
- Negative: Same as above but the field is set to -1 immediately after allocation and before any possible error path, and only later updated by ida_alloc; release still checks “field >= 0.” Expect no report.
- Negative: The ida_alloc assignment happens at the top of the function before any operation that can fail and before any call to put_device (as in [PATCH_DIFF]). Expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Run on drivers/remoteproc-like code to confirm detection on pre-patch ordering and non-detection post-patch; include mocks for zero-initializing allocation and release callbacks.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Inability to prove zero-initialization: mitigate by requiring zero-initializing allocation patterns or absence of explicit negative sentinel initialization.
- Over-approximate control-flow to put_device that never triggers release in practice: mitigate by correlating the release function to the same struct type and dev member.
- Complex aliasing between the object and its dev member: mitigate by field-sensitive alias analysis and requiring consistent base object tracking.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes release functions that call ida_free are reachable from put_device on the same object, which may not be statically provable in all kernels.
- Assumes objects are zero-initialized when allocated via certain APIs; exact allocator identification may be incomplete.
- Focuses on IDA-specific patterns (ida_alloc/ida_free) as evidenced by [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; similar issues with other alloc/free pairs are not covered.
