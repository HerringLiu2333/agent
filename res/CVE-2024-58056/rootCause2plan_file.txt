1. Plan Summary
Detect cases where a release/destructor function calls ida_free (or similar) on a struct field that may never have been allocated because the field starts at a non-negative default (e.g., 0 from kzalloc) and allocation is performed later, while error paths can trigger release first.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify release-type functions that invoke ida_free with a struct field argument. Conceptual signals: functions like rproc_type_release using container_of(...), then calling ida_free(&ida, obj->field) under a condition; map to root cause since invalid ida_free is the core issue per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] and [FILE_CONTENT].
2) Step 2: Confirm the guard condition around ida_free is “field >= 0” (or otherwise non-strictly allowing zero as valid). Conceptual signals: an if-check such as if (obj->field >= 0) before ida_free; reduces FPs by only flagging patterns where zero-default can pass, matching [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
3) Step 3: Locate the allocator/init function for the same struct that zero-initializes memory. Conceptual signals: kzalloc(sizeof(struct X), GFP_KERNEL) producing a zero-initialized instance, as in rproc_alloc using kzalloc in [FILE_CONTENT]; this supports the root cause that default 0 is present.
4) Step 4: Check that the ID field is not initialized to an invalid sentinel (e.g., -1) before any potential release. Conceptual signals: absence of an assignment like obj->field = -1 immediately after allocation; mitigate FPs by excluding safe initializations.
5) Step 5: Identify assignments of the field via ida_alloc (the actual allocation). Conceptual signals: obj->field = ida_alloc(&ida, GFP_KERNEL) (as in [PATCH_DIFF] and [FILE_CONTENT]); this marks the point when the ID becomes valid per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
6) Step 6: Analyze control flow to find error paths that can reach a release-triggering call before ida_alloc runs. Conceptual signals: goto put_device error branches prior to the ida_alloc line, where put_device(&obj->dev) can cause release (as shown in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [FILE_CONTENT]); maps to the ordering bug.
7) Step 7: Confirm that the allocator function calls put_device on failure, which triggers the release function. Conceptual signals: put_device(&obj->dev) in allocator, and the device’s type has the release set to the identified release function (rproc_type_release per [FILE_CONTENT]); reduces FPs by tying release invocation to the path.
8) Step 8: Check the relative order: if ida_alloc occurs after operations that can fail and goto put_device, flag. Conceptual signals: sequence where name/firmware/ops allocation happen, then ida_alloc later (pre-patch), per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]/[PATCH_DIFF]; this matches the exact flaw.
9) Step 9: Suppress when ida_alloc is performed early (before any failing calls) or the field is set invalid until successful allocation. Conceptual signals: ida_alloc immediately after device init and before other allocations (post-patch per [PATCH_DIFF]); mitigates FPs by recognizing fixed patterns.
10) Step 10: Optionally generalize to similar ID management APIs (e.g., idr_alloc/idr_remove) with the same “>= 0” guard and zero-initialization. Conceptual signals: release/destructor calling idr_remove based on non-negative field; aligns with broader class noted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
11) Step 11: Ensure the struct used in release matches the one allocated (via container_of) and the same field is tracked across functions. Conceptual signals: container_of(dev, struct type, member) in release and usage of the same type in allocator; mitigates misattribution.
12) Step 12: Report instances with a path from allocation to put_device prior to field assignment by ida_alloc, combined with >=0 guard in release calling ida_free. Conceptual signals: integrated control-flow/path existence and sequencing; maps directly to the CVE pattern.

3. Target Elements
- Release/destructor functions using container_of to recover the owning struct.
- Calls to ida_free (and similar ID-release APIs).
- Guard conditions around ida_free (comparisons against zero or negative).
- Allocation/init functions performing kzalloc for the struct.
- Assignments of fields via ida_alloc (ID acquisition sites).
- Error branches and goto labels (e.g., goto put_device) preceding ida_alloc.
- Calls to put_device on failure paths, and device type setup linking to the release function.
- Field initializations to sentinel values (e.g., -1) immediately after allocation.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the life of the ID field from allocation (kzalloc) through assignments, especially via ida_alloc.
- Control-flow path analysis from function entry to error labels that invoke put_device, verifying whether ida_alloc was reached.
- Interprocedural linkage: allocator sets up dev->type->release; release uses the same struct via container_of; connect these for accurate matching.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch rproc_alloc where kzalloc initializes rproc->index to 0, ida_alloc happens after name/firmware/ops, and errors goto put_device causing rproc_type_release’s “index >= 0” to call ida_free; expect a finding (based on [FILE_CONTENT], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]).
- Negative: Post-patch rproc_alloc where ida_alloc is performed early before other failures and the same release exists; expect no finding (per [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Negative: Variant where the field is explicitly set to -1 immediately after kzalloc and only made non-negative upon successful ida_alloc; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Run on drivers/remoteproc/remoteproc_core.c; ensure path-sensitive analysis to model goto put_device and release linkage.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Inaccurate linkage between put_device and the specific release function: mitigate by requiring matching device type and container_of usage.
- Fields that are set to valid IDs via other mechanisms before release: mitigate by confirming the only non-negative assignment is via ida_alloc.
- Cases where release isn’t reachable on those error paths: mitigate with path existence checks to put_device prior to ida_alloc.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes Linux device model semantics where put_device triggers the registered type->release; CodeQL must approximate this linkage.
- Assumes zero-initialization via kzalloc implies the field starts at 0 unless explicitly set; does not account for custom allocators or non-zero defaults.
- Does not fully model concurrency or asynchronous release timing; focuses on static sequencing and error-path reachability.
- Generalization to other ID alloc/free APIs depends on recognizing similar guards and allocation patterns; exact API list is not provided in materials.
