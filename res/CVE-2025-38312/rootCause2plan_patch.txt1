1. Plan Summary
Detect integer-overflow-to-zero risks where a refresh-derived value is doubled and later used as a divisor in the fbdev CVT path without an upper-bound validation, leading to division-by-zero.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify divisor sinks — integer divisions and calls into fb_cvt_hperiod where an argument is used as a divider. Signals: a variable directly in the denominator of a division or flowing as a parameter into fb_cvt_hperiod noted as using it as a divider.

2) Step 2: Find the upstream value used as the divisor (e.g., cvt.f_refresh) and track its dataflow back to its origins in the same function. Signals: assignments like cvt.f_refresh = cvt.refresh and earlier derivation from mode->refresh.

3) Step 3: Detect arithmetic doubling of the divisor variable before reaching the sink. Signals: multiplication by 2, left shift by 1, or equivalent operations on the variable along the dataflow path.

4) Step 4: Confirm that interlacing logic forces the doubling path. Signals: a control or assignment such as cvt.interlace = 1 that implies subsequent doubling of refresh frequency.

5) Step 5: Check for the absence of an upper-bound validation on the divisor variable prior to the doubling. Signals: no conditional guard comparing the variable against a safe bound (e.g., INT_MAX) in the same function before the arithmetic.

6) Step 6: Detect the presence of only minimal validation that ignores upper bounds. Signals: input checks limited to “!cvt.xres || !cvt.yres || !cvt.refresh” without any range check on cvt.f_refresh.

7) Step 7: Validate the type context that makes overflow plausible. Signals: the divisor variable is an integer type consistent with INT_MAX comparisons and subject to wrap-around when doubled.

8) Step 8: Confirm that the possibly overflowed value can reach the sink without being revalidated or clamped. Signals: no intervening checks ensuring nonzero or bounded range after doubling, before the division or fb_cvt_hperiod call.

9) Step 9: Report a finding when these conditions co-occur: (a) divisor variable originates from refresh, (b) is doubled under interlace logic, (c) lacks upper-bound guard (e.g., against INT_MAX), and (d) flows into a division or fb_cvt_hperiod.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes fb_cvt_hperiod uses the passed refresh-derived argument as a divisor; the function body is not provided.
- Assumes integer wrap-around behavior makes doubling an oversized unsigned/signed value yield zero; exact type widths are not specified.
- The checker infers risk from missing bounds checks rather than proving concrete overflow-to-zero for a specific input (e.g., 0x80000000).
- Scope is the fbdev CVT path; generalization to other subsystems is not covered by the provided materials.
