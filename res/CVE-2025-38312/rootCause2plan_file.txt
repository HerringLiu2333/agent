1. Plan Summary
Detect cases where an unsigned 32-bit value is multiplied (e.g., doubled) without an adequate upper-bound check and later used as a divisor, enabling overflow-to-zero and division-by-zero (as in fb_cvt_hperiod using cvt->f_refresh), based on the patterns in fbcvt.c.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify integer division operations where the divisor is a variable/field of unsigned 32-bit type (u32) or equivalent. This targets patterns like “1000000000 / cvt->f_refresh” seen in fb_cvt_hperiod (from FILE_CONTENT), which directly cause DoS if the divisor is zero; exclude cases where divisor type is wider (e.g., u64) to reduce false positives.
2) Step 2: For each such divisor, perform backward dataflow to its defining assignments across functions. Track flows through struct fields (e.g., cvt->f_refresh) set in a caller and consumed in a callee (based on fb_find_mode_cvt setting cvt.f_refresh and fb_cvt_hperiod using it; FILE_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
3) Step 3: Along that dataflow, find arithmetic that scales the value by a constant ≥ 2 in unsigned 32-bit context (e.g., f_refresh *= 2 when interlaced). This matches the root cause where doubling a u32 can wrap to zero (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS); ignore scaling performed in a provably wider type with safe cast-back after checks.
4) Step 4: Check for the absence of a post-scaling zero-guard before the division sink or call into the sink function. If there is no “if (value == 0) bail/error” after the multiplication and before the divide, the overflow-to-zero would not be caught (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS shows no such guard in fb_cvt_hperiod).
5) Step 5: Check for the absence of a pre-scaling upper-bound guard that prevents overflow (e.g., value > INT_MAX when multiplying by 2). Flag flows that lack a check analogous to the patch’s “cvt.f_refresh > INT_MAX” (PATCH_DIFF) on all paths that reach the scaling site.
6) Step 6: Confirm that the division sink (or its callee) does not internally validate the divisor against zero or range prior to use. This aligns with fb_cvt_hperiod’s direct division on cvt->f_refresh without a guard (FILE_CONTENT).
7) Step 7: Ensure the scaled value is derived from externally influenced inputs or parameters (e.g., mode->refresh copied to cvt.refresh then to cvt.f_refresh; FILE_CONTENT) or otherwise non-constant sources. This reduces false positives from fully controlled, constant-safe computations.
8) Step 8: Require control-flow feasibility from scaling to division (no intervening reassignments to a safe constant). This avoids flagging cases where the risky value is overwritten or sanitized before reaching the sink.
9) Step 9: In interprocedural cases, match struct field flows: field assigned in caller, struct pointer passed to callee, callee uses same field as divisor. This mirrors fb_find_mode_cvt setting cvt.f_refresh and calling fb_cvt_hperiod(&cvt) which divides by cvt->f_refresh (FILE_CONTENT).
10) Step 10: Optionally recognize domain-specific signals to prioritize: scaling gated by a mode flag (e.g., interlaced) and division by timing-related constants. This mirrors the interlaced doubling and timing math context (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS), improving precision without excluding general cases.
11) Step 11: Deprioritize cases where an equivalent bound is enforced (e.g., for factor k, check value ≤ UINT_MAX/k) or where a safe-range contract is enforced via earlier validation in all callers. This aligns with the fix strategy (PATCH_DIFF) and reduces false positives.
12) Step 12: Report with path explanation: source assignment, scaling site, missing guards, and division sink. This maps precisely to the root cause flow described (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS) and aids actionable remediation.

3. Target Elements
- Integer division expressions and their divisor operands.
- Assignments to unsigned 32-bit variables/struct fields used as divisors.
- Arithmetic scaling operations (multiplication by constants ≥ 2) on those values.
- Condition checks guarding these values (zero-checks and upper-bound checks).
- Function calls passing structs/pointers where callee uses a field as divisor (e.g., fb_cvt_hperiod(&cvt)).
- Flag-driven branches that trigger scaling (e.g., interlaced mode).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from input-like sources (function parameters, struct fields from caller input, e.g., mode->refresh) to divisor variables/fields.
- Track transformations including assignments, field copies, and multiplications by constants.
- Interprocedural flow: caller initializes/updates a struct field, passes pointer to callee, callee divides by that field.
- Guard analysis: identify presence/absence of zero checks after scaling and upper-bound checks before scaling; require that these checks dominate the path to the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function sets v.f = param; if (flag) v.f *= 2; call sink(&v); sink divides by v.f without zero or range checks. Expect a finding mirroring fb_find_mode_cvt/fb_cvt_hperiod (FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Negative: Same as above but with a pre-scaling check “if (v.f > INT_MAX) return err;” or a post-scaling check “if (!v.f) return err;” or using 64-bit math for scaling with safe cast after validation. Expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Include interprocedural struct-field flow and intra-procedural division in callee; include variants with/without guards to exercise false-positive mitigations.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: Requires interprocedural dataflow with guard-dominance analysis, but patterns (u32 scaling then division) are well-scoped and strongly signaled by the provided code.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Values proven range-limited by domain constraints not modeled by the checker; mitigate by requiring explicit upper-bound or zero guards.
- Scaling in widened types (e.g., u64) but later truncated safely; mitigate by checking actual type at scaling and before sink.
- Alternate sanitization in helper functions not recognized; mitigate by recognizing common guard patterns (zero or upper-bound checks) along the path.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes accurate identification of unsigned 32-bit types and constant factors; macro-induced type changes may be opaque.
- Assumes absence of overflow-safe arithmetic unless explicit guards are present; cannot prove semantic constraints beyond visible checks.
- Generalization to multipliers other than 2 relies on conservative UINT_MAX/k reasoning; the patch specifically used INT_MAX for the doubling case (PATCH_DIFF, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
