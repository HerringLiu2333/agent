1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58059

2. Vulnerability Type
Deadlock / Denial-of-Service due to missing initialization-state check (probe failure path race)

3. Root Cause Summary
uvc_status_unregister() unconditionally invoked uvc_status_suspend() and uvc_input_unregister() assuming dev->status had been initialized. When uvc_probe() failed before uvc_status_init() ran, dev->status remained NULL, yet uvc_status_unregister() still executed. Entering suspend/unregister paths without an initialized status context led to a deadlock in the cleanup path during probe failure.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Media subsystem, USB Video Class (uvcvideo), file drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_status.c.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
uvc_status_unregister(struct uvc_device *dev) lacked a precondition check for dev->status and called:
- uvc_status_suspend(dev);
- uvc_input_unregister(dev);
even when status had never been initialized.

3) Trigger Condition:
Failure in uvc_probe() that causes its error path to call uvc_status_unregister() before uvc_status_init() has been executed, leaving dev->status as NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Executing suspend/unregister routines without an initialized status object causes a deadlock during device probe cleanup (as reported by syzbot), resulting in a kernel-level hang in the driver path and a denial-of-service for device enumeration.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Defensive initialization-state check in uvc_status_unregister() to short-circuit when dev->status is NULL, preventing entry into suspend/unregister logic that assumes an initialized status context.

2) Key Code Changes:
In uvc_status_unregister():
- Added:
  if (!dev->status)
      return;
This precedes existing calls to uvc_status_suspend(dev) and uvc_input_unregister(dev).

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No new locks or ordering changes were introduced. The early-return guard prevents invoking code that may acquire locks or wait on resources in an invalid state, thereby eliminating the deadlock observed when unregister was called prior to initialization.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Improper state handling in probe error paths can allow local attackers (or malformed/malicious USB devices) to trigger deadlocks, leading to denial-of-service by stalling device enumeration or blocking related kernel threads. While not a memory-safety flaw, ensuring robust init/uninit sequencing and state checks is critical to maintain kernel availability and resilience against fuzzing or hostile peripherals.
