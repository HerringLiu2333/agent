1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58059

2. Vulnerability Type
Deadlock due to missing pre-initialization state validation (improper cleanup on error path)

3. Root Cause Summary
uvc_status_unregister() unconditionally invoked uvc_status_suspend() and uvc_input_unregister() even when dev->status had not been initialized. When uvc_probe() failed before uvc_status_init() ran, calling uvc_status_unregister() with dev->status == NULL led to a deadlock in the probe failure cleanup path. The flaw is the lack of a guard for the uninitialized status context in uvc_status_unregister().

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Media subsystem, USB Video Class (UVC) driver; drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_status.c

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
uvc_status_unregister(struct uvc_device *dev) lacked a NULL check for dev->status and unconditionally executed:
- uvc_status_suspend(dev);
- uvc_input_unregister(dev);
This assumed that uvc_status_init() had already set up dev->status.

3) Trigger Condition:
uvc_probe() fails and, in its error handling path, calls uvc_status_unregister() before uvc_status_init() has been called, leaving dev->status == NULL.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The unconditional suspend/unregister operations on an uninitialized status context caused a deadlock during device probing cleanup, stalling the probe path and potentially hanging the system (DoS). The patch description explicitly reports a deadlock during uvc_probe tied to this sequence.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add a defensive early return in uvc_status_unregister() to skip suspend/unregister operations when dev->status is NULL, ensuring teardown only occurs after successful initialization.

2) Key Code Changes:
In drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_status.c, at the start of uvc_status_unregister():
- Inserted:
  if (!dev->status)
      return;
No other logic changes.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
By avoiding calls to uvc_status_suspend() and uvc_input_unregister() when dev->status is NULL, the patch prevents entering suspend/unregister paths that may acquire locks or wait on resources that were never initialized, thereby removing the deadlock window in the probe failure path. It enforces correct ordering (init before unregister) and avoids race-prone cleanup when initialization hasnâ€™t occurred.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Ensuring error-path cleanup routines validate initialization state prevents deadlocks and system hangs, improving robustness against malformed or failing devices and fuzzing inputs (as reported by syzbot). This pattern reduces denial-of-service risks by guarding teardown code with initialization checks, a common requirement in complex driver probe/unregister sequences.
