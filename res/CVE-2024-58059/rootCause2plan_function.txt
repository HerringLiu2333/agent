1. Plan Summary
Detect cleanup/unregister functions that operate on a device/resource status without first checking whether initialization occurred (e.g., dev->status is NULL), leading to deadlock when called from probe error paths.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: locate candidate cleanup functions. Signals: functions with names containing "unregister" or "suspend" and taking a device/context pointer, as in uvc_status_unregister and uvc_status_suspend; maps to the cleanup phase implicated in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; reduce FPs by scoping to modules where a corresponding "*_init" exists (e.g., uvc_status_init per [PATCH_DIFF]).
2) Step 2: Objective: identify the resource/initialization flag field. Signals: a struct field (e.g., dev->status) that is set during an init function and referenced by cleanup routines; maps to the root cause where dev->status remained NULL (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); reduce FPs by requiring evidence that the init function writes the field (assignment or non-NULL set) or that the patch added a check on it (per [PATCH_DIFF]).
3) Step 3: Objective: detect cleanup functions that lack a guard on the init state. Signals: absence of a conditional/early-return check like "if (!dev->status) return" or "if (dev->status) ..." before performing suspend/unregister actions (as was missing in [FUNCTION_CONTENT] and added in [PATCH_DIFF]); maps to the missing precondition that caused deadlock (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); reduce FPs by confirming the same field is the one guarded in the corresponding patch or init function.
4) Step 4: Objective: confirm the cleanup function performs status-dependent operations. Signals: calls to routines with names "suspend"/"unregister" on the same device/context (e.g., uvc_status_suspend(dev), uvc_input_unregister(dev) in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); maps to operations that assume an initialized status context (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); reduce FPs by requiring multiple such calls or at least one call referencing the same subsystem’s status feature.
5) Step 5: Objective: determine potential call paths where cleanup may run before init. Signals: call graph edges indicating cleanup is reachable from probe/error paths or without dominance by "*_init" invocation (per description of uvc_probe failure in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); maps to the trigger condition (cleanup invoked before init); reduce FPs by flagging only when at least one path lacks a prior init call or when cleanup is externally callable without preconditions.
6) Step 6: Objective: check for use or dereference of the status field within called routines. Signals: if interprocedural analysis shows called functions reference dev->status or rely on it (inferred by naming and subsystem grouping per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); maps to the assumption that suspend/unregister depend on initialized status; reduce FPs by limiting to functions within the same file/subsystem (drivers/media/usb/uvc per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
7) Step 7: Objective: prioritize findings that match the patch’s remediation pattern. Signals: candidate functions where adding an early return on "!status" would align with the fix seen in [PATCH_DIFF]; maps to the concrete guard that resolves the deadlock; reduce FPs by deprioritizing cases already guarded or using equivalent checks.
8) Step 8: Objective: flag and rank risks. Signals: cleanup without guard + reachable before init + calls to status-dependent operations; maps to high-confidence manifestation of the CVE class (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); reduce FPs by requiring at least two of the above signals for reporting and annotating uncertainty when reachability is partial.

3. Target Elements
- Functions: "*_unregister", "*_suspend", and their paired "*_init" in the same subsystem/module.
- Struct fields on device/context objects that serve as initialization-state (e.g., dev->status).
- Call sites invoking suspend/unregister operations on the device/context.
- Condition checks guarding cleanup with early-return on initialization state.
- Call graph paths from probe/error handling to cleanup vs. init.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the initialization flow: assignments in "*_init" to the status field vs. absence of such flows before cleanup on some paths.
- Control-flow dominance: whether cleanup calls are reachable without a prior check or initialization of the status field.
- Guard propagation: presence/absence of conditions checking the status field that gate calls to suspend/unregister.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch uvc_status_unregister that calls uvc_status_suspend(dev) and uvc_input_unregister(dev) without checking dev->status (as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); expected: flagged.
- Negative: Patched uvc_status_unregister with "if (!dev->status) return;" before cleanup calls (as in [PATCH_DIFF]); expected: not flagged.
- Test harness notes: Include a synthetic probe error path calling cleanup before init (reflecting [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]) and a benign case where cleanup is always dominated by init and guarded.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: requires interprocedural control-flow/dominance analysis and heuristic pairing of init/unregister functions.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Cleanup functions safe to run without init; mitigate by requiring evidence of a status field and status-dependent calls.
- Misidentifying unrelated fields as initialization-state; mitigate by tying the field to "*_init" writes or patch-added checks.
- Uncertain reachability from probe failure paths; mitigate by reporting with confidence levels and requiring at least two corroborating signals.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The exact struct definition and whether called routines truly depend on the status field are not provided; assumptions based on naming and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Precise call paths from uvc_probe are not available; reachability analysis may be conservative.
- The plan generalizes the naming pattern ("init"/"unregister"/"suspend") from [PATCH_DIFF] and [FUNCTION_CONTENT]; other subsystems may use different nomenclature.
