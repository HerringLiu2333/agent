1. Plan Summary
Insufficient information to derive a vulnerability-specific detection strategy: both the patch details and root-cause analysis are missing, so the plan below outlines a conditional, symbol-driven approach that must be instantiated once PATCH_DIFF or PATCH_DESCRIPTION becomes available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify the concrete symbols and conditions implicated by the fix. Conceptual signals — Names of modified/added functions, fields, constants, guards, or preconditions introduced by the patch; locations where checks were added. FP mitigation — Scope analysis to the exact symbols and modules/files touched by the patch.
2) Step 2: Objective — Derive the pre-patch anti-pattern from the added checks. Conceptual signals — Call sites or code paths using the impacted symbols without the newly introduced precondition/guard/validation. FP mitigation — Require that the code path context (module/namespace/subsystem) matches that of the patch and that the missing check is the same predicate introduced by the patch.
3) Step 3: Objective — If the patch adds a return-value/error check, find sites that ignore or mishandle it. Conceptual signals — Calls to the patched API where the return value is unused, not compared to failure indicators, or used as if success. FP mitigation — Exclude calls wrapped by helper functions that enforce the new check; confirm that the ignored value is semantically an error/status per the patch.
4) Step 4: Objective — If the patch adds a null/initialized/permission/capability check, detect uses lacking that precondition. Conceptual signals — Dereferences, state transitions, or privileged operations on the relevant object before any guard equivalent to the patch’s added check. FP mitigation — Require dominance analysis showing no guarding condition on all paths; restrict to the same object types or handles identified in the patch.
5) Step 5: Objective — If the patch adds bounds/length checks, locate memory or copy operations missing them. Conceptual signals — Buffer writes, copies, or allocations involving the same buffers/parameters without a preceding size comparison consistent with the patch. FP mitigation — Confirm the sink and operands match those guarded in the patch and exclude cases with provably safe fixed sizes or validated invariants.
6) Step 6: Objective — If the patch introduces locking/ordering, detect race-prone accesses lacking the new synchronization. Conceptual signals — Reads/writes of the same shared state without holding the newly required lock or without the new ordering constraint. FP mitigation — Require interprocedural confirmation that no equivalent lock/ordering is held; restrict to the same state and lock identified by the patch.
7) Step 7: Objective — If the patch modifies lifetime/cleanup, find paths that leak or double-use resources without the new pattern. Conceptual signals — Allocation/open/attach without the added cleanup/error-branch release or without the new ownership transfer checks. FP mitigation — Require path feasibility to exit points and match the same resource types from the patch.
8) Step 8: Objective — Consolidate findings to “pre-patch flaw replicas” only. Conceptual signals — Findings must simultaneously (a) use the same symbols or data types as the patch and (b) miss the same guard/handling added in the patch. FP mitigation — Filter out variants that already implement semantically equivalent checks or are outside the subsystem touched by the patch.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified or referenced by the patch.
- Call sites to the patched APIs.
- Condition checks/guards added by the patch (null/length/state/error/permission).
- Memory and I/O sinks adjacent to patch changes (alloc/copy/format/parse/IO).
- Lock acquisition/release sites and shared-state accesses if locks introduced.
- Resource lifetime transitions (alloc/open/attach/close/free) altered by the patch.
- Function return-value uses and error-handling branches related to the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- To be defined once PATCH_DIFF or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS is available; track flows from the same sources and into the same sinks that the patch protects, ensuring the new guard is absent along the path.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal example mirroring the pre-patch pattern where a call to the patched API (or memory/state operation) occurs without the newly added guard/check/lock/cleanup.
- Negative: The same example updated to include the precise guard/handling introduced by the patch, plus variants with semantically equivalent protections.
- Test harness notes: Instantiate symbol names, guard predicates, and sink types directly from the patch to avoid overgeneralization.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Blocked pending patch/root-cause details; once provided, effort is medium to specialize symbol- and predicate-aware analysis with path and dominance checks.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Overgeneralizing guard equivalence; mitigate by matching the exact predicate/symbols from the patch.
- Alternate enforcement layers (wrappers, invariants); mitigate via interprocedural recognition of wrappers and dominance of equivalent checks.
- Context differences (different subsystem or data types); mitigate by constraining to files/modules/types changed in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS are unavailable, so no vulnerability-specific signals can be asserted.
- The plan assumes the patch introduced discernible guards/conditions/synchronization/lifetime changes; if not, additional information is required to define signals.
- Dataflow sources/sinks, error conventions, and symbol names must be populated from the actual patch before implementation.
