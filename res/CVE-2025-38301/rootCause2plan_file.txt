1. Plan Summary
Without [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS], the exact vulnerability class is unknown; this plan provides a configurable detection scaffold that derives the precondition/guard introduced by the patch and flags call sites/operations that omit it.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Establish the vulnerability’s guard/precondition from the patch — look for added checks, sanitization, error handling, permission/locking, or API sequencing in [PATCH_DIFF] — mitigate FPs by anchoring the inferred rule strictly to constructs introduced in the patch (same functions/APIs/variables).
2) Step 2: Identify the protected operation (“sink”) — conceptually, find operations/calls that gained a preceding condition or wrapper in [PATCH_DIFF] — mitigate FPs by scoping sinks to exact functions or expressions changed in the patch.
3) Step 3: Generalize the precondition into a check requirement (“must check X before Y”) — capture the logical predicate structure (e.g., null/bounds/return-value/permission/lock state) from [PATCH_DIFF] — mitigate FPs by requiring structural equivalence (same variable/alias and same predicate semantics).
4) Step 4: Find call sites/operations invoking the sink without the new precondition — search dominant regions before the sink for an equivalent guard and flag when absent — mitigate FPs by excluding cases where the guard is enforced in a controlling wrapper or helper function added per [PATCH_DIFF].
5) Step 5: Model wrappers introduced by the patch — detect functions newly added or modified to encapsulate the sink and enforce the guard — mitigate FPs by marking calls through these wrappers as safe via interprocedural summaries.
6) Step 6: Track dataflow into the sink where the guard implies input validation — conceptually trace flows from inputs/parameters/external sources to the sink and require the inferred validation along the path — mitigate FPs by restricting sources to those referenced in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]/[PATCH_DIFF] (once available) and by recognizing equivalent validation upstream.
7) Step 7: Handle return-value checks — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds checking of a callee’s return, flag uses of that return to drive sensitive behavior without an equivalent check — mitigate FPs by limiting to the same callee and matching the same failure conditions.
8) Step 8: Handle null/bounds checks — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds dereference/index guards, flag similar dereferences/indices on the same variable/alias without equivalent guards — mitigate FPs by requiring clear dominance and matching variable identity/aliasing.
9) Step 9: Handle permission/authorization patterns — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds capability/role checks before an operation, flag operations of the same kind without the check in the same module/subsystem — mitigate FPs by matching the exact permission API or condition introduced.
10) Step 10: Handle locking/concurrency patterns — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds lock acquisition around shared state, flag accesses to the same state without the lock within relevant functions/threads — mitigate FPs by confirming shared object identity and consistent lock pairing.
11) Step 11: Handle integer/overflow sanitization — if [PATCH_DIFF] introduces bounds/overflow guards before arithmetic/allocations, flag equivalent arithmetic/allocs using the same inputs without guards — mitigate FPs by matching operand sources and the same arithmetic/size computations.
12) Step 12: Rank findings by proximity to patched code — prioritize paths/functions in the same files or packages changed in [PATCH_DIFF] — mitigate FPs by de-prioritizing distant or semantically divergent contexts.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified in the patch; functions calling patched APIs.
- Call sites of sinks (APIs/operations) that gained a guard in the patch.
- Condition checks (null/bounds/permission/return-value/lock state).
- Lock/unlock boundaries and shared-state access sites.
- Function return-value uses and error-handling branches.
- Allocation sites, arithmetic operations, and index/dereference expressions.
- Wrapper/helper functions added or modified to enforce guards.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from parameters/external inputs to the sink operation, requiring the inferred validation before the sink is reached.
- Recognize and credit validation predicates equivalent to those introduced in the patch (even if performed in upstream functions).
- Model wrapper functions that enforce the guard as sanitizers, stopping taint at their boundary.
- For return-value checks, model the return as tainted until checked against the specific failure predicate introduced in the patch.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippet invoking the identified sink without the added guard (e.g., using return value unchecked, dereferencing/indexing without null/bounds, performing privileged action without authorization, accessing shared state without lock); expect a finding.
- Negative: Post-patch snippet where the sink is protected by the exact guard/wrapper shown in [PATCH_DIFF]; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Build small, isolated samples replicating the guard pattern from the patch and measure the checker’s ability to distinguish guarded vs. unguarded variants; include wrapper-enforced cases to verify interprocedural recognition.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — the absence of [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] necessitates a generic, configurable framework and later specialization once details are provided.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically different but superficially similar checks; mitigate by requiring structural equivalence to the patch-introduced predicate.
- Guards enforced in wrappers not recognized; mitigate via interprocedural summaries of modified/added wrappers.
- Contexts where the sink is safe by construction (e.g., invariant guarantees); mitigate by limiting scope to files/modules touched in the patch and by recognizing invariants documented in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] (once available).
- Alias analysis mismatches leading to missed/extra guards; mitigate by requiring strong variable/alias matching to the patch variables.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the vulnerability class and exact guard/sink are unknown.
- The plan assumes the patch introduced a recognizable guard/precondition (check, wrapper, sequencing) that can be generalized; if the fix is non-structural (e.g., algorithmic change), this approach may not apply.
- Module/file scoping, source identification, and predicate semantics must be derived from the missing materials before specialization.
