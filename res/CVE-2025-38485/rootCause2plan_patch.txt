1. Plan Summary
Detect races where a buffer teardown function disables FIFO/buffer mode without first synchronizing the device IRQ, while an interrupt path reads indio_dev->active_scan_mask (via iio_for_each_active_channel), leading to a use-after-free/NULL dereference.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify buffer teardown functions that disable FIFO/buffer mode — look for functions that call a state-change routine with a false/disable argument (e.g., __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false)) — reduce FPs by prioritizing functions named like "*buffer_predisable" as in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
2) Step 2: Within those functions, check for the presence of an IRQ quiescing call before the disable (e.g., synchronize_irq on a device IRQ) — signals: absence of synchronize_irq(...) immediately prior to the disabling call — maps to [PATCH_DIFF], which added synchronize_irq(data->irq) to fix the race.
3) Step 3: Find interrupt-path functions in the same driver/module — signals: functions named "*interrupt" or those referenced in IRQ stack traces (fxls8962af_interrupt in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]) — reduce FPs by restricting to functions in the same file/module as the teardown.
4) Step 4: Locate functions that flush the FIFO and iterate active channels — signals: calls to fxls8962af_fifo_flush or loops/macro usage of iio_for_each_active_channel(indio_dev, …), implying reads of indio_dev->active_scan_mask — maps to the dereference site described in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
5) Step 5: Establish a call path from the interrupt function to the flush/iteration function — signals: callgraph edge fxls8962af_interrupt → fxls8962af_fifo_flush per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] — reduce FPs by requiring a direct or obvious call relationship.
6) Step 6: Confirm that the flush/iteration function reads indio_dev->active_scan_mask — signals: use of iio_for_each_active_channel with the same indio_dev pointer — maps to the UAF on active_scan_mask in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
7) Step 7: Link the teardown function’s device context to the interrupt/flush path — signals: shared parameters/fields (same indio_dev or driver data struct) across functions — reduces FPs by ensuring both sides operate on the same device instance.
8) Step 8: Flag when a teardown function disables buffer/FIFO mode without prior synchronize_irq and a concurrent interrupt path can call the flush/iteration that reads active_scan_mask — maps directly to the race described in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] — reduce FPs by requiring both conditions.
9) Step 9: Optionally detect that the synchronize_irq argument corresponds to the driver’s IRQ field (e.g., data->irq per [PATCH_DIFF]) — signals: device data field passed to synchronize_irq — reduces FPs by ensuring synchronization targets the relevant IRQ.
10) Step 10: Suppress findings if alternative IRQ quiescing is present in the same control path (e.g., an earlier synchronize_irq before disable) — signals: any synchronize_irq executed in the same function prior to the state change — reduces FPs by acknowledging equivalent synchronization.
11) Step 11: Highlight risk severity if the iteration uses bit-scan helpers (e.g., find_first_bit via iio_for_each_active_channel) — signals: patterns that imply bit scanning on a mask — maps to the crash stack (_find_first_bit_le) in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and emphasizes impact.
12) Step 12: Deprioritize cases where the interrupt path does not reach the FIFO flush/active channel iteration — signals: absence of callgraph linkage — reduces FPs by focusing on the proven hazardous access pattern.

3. Target Elements
- Functions that disable buffer/FIFO mode (e.g., buffer_predisable).
- Call sites to state-change routines with a “disable” argument.
- Calls to synchronize_irq and their ordering relative to the disable.
- Interrupt handler functions (e.g., named "*interrupt") and their callgraphs.
- Functions using iio_for_each_active_channel or otherwise reading indio_dev->active_scan_mask.
- Shared device context variables/fields (e.g., indio_dev, data, data->irq).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the device context (indio_dev/driver data) through teardown and interrupt/flush functions to ensure they refer to the same device.
- Track the flow from driver data to synchronize_irq’s argument (e.g., data->irq) to confirm proper IRQ synchronization targeting.
- Track callgraph flow from interrupt handler to FIFO flush to the active_scan_mask access.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A buffer_predisable function calls __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false) without a preceding synchronize_irq(data->irq), while fxls8962af_interrupt calls fxls8962af_fifo_flush that iterates iio_for_each_active_channel(indio_dev, …); expect a finding.
- Negative: Same as above but with synchronize_irq(data->irq) immediately before disabling buffer/FIFO mode (as in [PATCH_DIFF]); expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Use a small driver-like module where the teardown, interrupt, and flush functions share a common indio_dev/driver data struct to validate context linking.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Drivers that quiesce IRQs via alternative mechanisms not explicitly visible (mitigation: look for synchronize_irq specifically and optionally document other mechanisms as limitations).
- Functions named "*interrupt" that are not actual IRQ handlers (mitigation: require callgraph linkage to the flush function and shared device context).
- Cases where active_scan_mask access is safe due to other undisclosed locks (mitigation: require the specific iio_for_each_active_channel access pattern and absence of synchronize_irq before disable).

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes synchronize_irq is the required quiescing method; other valid synchronization mechanisms may exist but are not captured in [PATCH_DIFF].
- Assumes iio_for_each_active_channel implies reading indio_dev->active_scan_mask as per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Cannot determine kernel core behavior (e.g., when active_scan_mask is cleared/freed) beyond the described race in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Interrupt handler identification relies on naming and callgraph hints from [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; precise IRQ registration is not analyzed due to missing context.
