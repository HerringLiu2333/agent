1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38485

2. Vulnerability Type
Use-after-free due to interrupt/teardown race, leading to NULL pointer dereference

3. Root Cause Summary
fxls8962af_fifo_flush() iterates channels via iio_for_each_active_channel(indio_dev, …), reading indio_dev->active_scan_mask, while buffer teardown can concurrently clear/free that mask. The pre-patch buffer disable path (fxls8962af_buffer_predisable) did not synchronize with the device IRQ, allowing fxls8962af_interrupt -> fxls8962af_fifo_flush to run while buffer mode was being disabled, causing a race on active_scan_mask. This missing synchronization created a window where fxls8962af_fifo_flush dereferenced a stale/NULL mask, triggering a use-after-free/NULL dereference in find_first_bit().

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Industrial I/O (IIO) accelerometer driver: drivers/iio/accel/fxls8962af

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- fxls8962af_fifo_flush() uses indio_dev->active_scan_mask via iio_for_each_active_channel() without ensuring indio_dev remains in buffer mode.
- fxls8962af_buffer_predisable() disabled buffer/FIFO state without first quiescing the IRQ, leaving the interrupt handler free to run concurrently.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Concurrent execution of fxls8962af_interrupt (which calls fxls8962af_fifo_flush) while fxls8962af_buffer_predisable is disabling buffer mode.
- During this overlap, the IIO core can clear/free active_scan_mask, and the interrupt-driven flush still tries to read it.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Dereference of indio_dev->active_scan_mask during iio_for_each_active_channel() calls into _find_first_bit_le on a freed/NULL pointer, causing “Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference” with stack: _find_first_bit_le → fxls8962af_fifo_flush → fxls8962af_interrupt → irq_thread_fn → irq_thread.
- Results in kernel crash (DoS) and a classic UAF race in the IRQ path.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce IRQ synchronization before disabling buffer mode to eliminate the race window between the IRQ handler and buffer teardown.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In fxls8962af_buffer_predisable():
  - Added synchronize_irq(data->irq);
  - This is placed immediately before __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(data, false), ensuring no interrupt is executing when buffer/FIFO is turned off.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- synchronize_irq(data->irq) acts as a barrier that waits for any in-flight interrupt handler (including threaded IRQ path) to complete before state changes occur.
- This orders operations so that fxls8962af_interrupt/fxls8962af_fifo_flush cannot access active_scan_mask while buffer mode is being disabled, removing the UAF/NULL deref race without introducing additional locks.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This fix underscores the need to quiesce device interrupts before tearing down shared state used by IRQ handlers, especially in IIO drivers where buffer and scan masks can be invalidated on disable. Failure to synchronize IRQs during teardown is a common kernel anti-pattern that leads to race-induced UAF/NULL dereferences and system instability. Similar drivers should ensure IRQs are disabled or synchronized before modifying or freeing buffer-related structures to prevent exploitable concurrency bugs.
