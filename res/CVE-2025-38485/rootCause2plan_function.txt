1. Plan Summary
Detect IIO buffer teardown paths that disable a device’s buffer interrupt and change FIFO/buffer mode without first synchronizing with the device IRQ, risking a race where the IRQ handler concurrently accesses indio_dev->active_scan_mask (as in CVE-2025-38485).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — find buffer pre-disable/teardown routines in the fxls8962af driver; Signals — functions taking struct iio_dev* and named like fxls8962af_buffer_predisable, or that call fxls8962af_standby and __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false); FP mitigation — restrict to functions in the same driver file that manipulate buffer/FIFO state (based on FUNCTION_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
2) Step 2: Objective — locate where the device buffer interrupt is disabled; Signals — calls that clear FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN via regmap_clear_bits(data->regmap, FXLS8962AF_INT_EN, FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN); FP mitigation — require the call to appear within a buffer predisable/teardown routine from Step 1 (supported by FUNCTION_CONTENT).
3) Step 3: Objective — identify subsequent buffer/FIFO mode change that triggers teardown; Signals — calls to __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(data, false) after the interrupt-disable call; FP mitigation — ensure a clear control-flow ordering: interrupt disable precedes FIFO mode false in the same function (FUNCTION_CONTENT, PATCH_DIFF).
4) Step 4: Objective — check for synchronization with the IRQ thread between disabling the interrupt source and changing FIFO mode; Signals — presence/absence of a synchronize_irq(data->irq) call placed between the two calls; FP mitigation — only flag when synchronize_irq is completely absent from the interval or not present in the function at all (PATCH_DIFF shows correct placement).
5) Step 5: Objective — confirm that an interrupt handler exists that can run concurrently; Signals — functions in the same driver named fxls8962af_interrupt or referenced by irq threading (e.g., irq_thread_fn call stack) and reachable from the registered IRQ; FP mitigation — require that the driver has an interrupt handler function and a data->irq field used for IRQ operations (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS stack trace and mention of data->irq).
6) Step 6: Objective — confirm the interrupt path accesses active_scan_mask via channel iteration; Signals — a function reachable from the interrupt handler calling fxls8962af_fifo_flush or using iio_for_each_active_channel (which dereferences indio_dev->active_scan_mask); FP mitigation — in this driver, accept fxls8962af_fifo_flush as sufficient evidence (PATCH_DESCRIPTION and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
7) Step 7: Objective — tie teardown to the structure accessed by IRQ path; Signals — teardown function (from Step 1) is part of buffer mode exit, which per analysis invalidates/clears active_scan_mask; FP mitigation — restrict findings to IIO buffer disable context where __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false) is executed (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS explains mask invalidation during buffer teardown).
8) Step 8: Objective — ensure the ordering is unsafe; Signals — no synchronize_irq between clearing FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN and calling __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false), even if synchronize_irq exists elsewhere; FP mitigation — allow cases where synchronize_irq occurs after disabling the source and before mode change (PATCH_DIFF demonstrates the safe order).
9) Step 9: Objective — reduce FPs where other synchronization might exist; Signals — optionally detect free_irq/disable_irq[_sync] or driver-specific IRQ serialization if present; FP mitigation — if disable_irq_sync or equivalent strong IRQ quiescing is found in the interval, do not flag (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS implies synchronize_irq is required; treat others conservatively if clearly quiescent).
10) Step 10: Objective — report precise diagnostic; Signals — highlight the gap between the specific interrupt disable call and subsequent FIFO mode change without synchronize_irq(data->irq); FP mitigation — only report when all prior steps confirm the IRQ path exists and uses active_scan_mask.

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions of buffer teardown routines (e.g., fxls8962af_buffer_predisable).
- Call sites to regmap_clear_bits disabling FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN.
- Call sites to __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(data, false).
- Calls to synchronize_irq with the same device IRQ (data->irq).
- Interrupt handler functions (e.g., fxls8962af_interrupt) and their callees (fxls8962af_fifo_flush).
- Uses of iio_for_each_active_channel (channel iteration implying active_scan_mask access).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the device-private pointer “data” originating from iio_priv(indio_dev) to verify consistent use: data->regmap, data->irq, and argument to __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode.
- Establish control-flow ordering: regmap_clear_bits (disable buffer IRQ) → [optional synchronize_irq] → __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false).
- Reachability from interrupt path: fxls8962af_interrupt → fxls8962af_fifo_flush → iio_for_each_active_channel (active_scan_mask usage), to confirm concurrent access risk.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch fxls8962af_buffer_predisable from FUNCTION_CONTENT where regmap_clear_bits disables FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN and __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(false) follows with no synchronize_irq; expect a report.
- Negative: Patched function from PATCH_DIFF with synchronize_irq(data->irq) inserted between the two calls; expect no report.
- Negative: A function that clears FXLS8962AF_INT_EN_BUF_EN but does not change FIFO mode; expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Run on the driver file containing these functions; assert control-flow and dataflow edges resolve “data” consistently; verify call-graph includes fxls8962af_interrupt → fxls8962af_fifo_flush.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires interprocedural call-graph analysis for IRQ path confirmation and intra-procedural ordering checks; high priority for kernel driver safety given the crash in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS and PATCH_DESCRIPTION.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Other synchronization mechanisms (e.g., disable_irq_sync or free_irq) not recognized: mitigate by checking for well-known quiescing calls in the critical interval.
- Drivers that disable buffer interrupts but do not access active_scan_mask in IRQ path: mitigate by requiring the interrupt path evidence via fxls8962af_fifo_flush/iio_for_each_active_channel reachability.
- Macros obscuring calls or driver-specific IRQ serialization: mitigate by conservative reporting only when clear ordering signals are present.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes __fxls8962af_fifo_set_mode(..., false) participates in buffer teardown that invalidates active_scan_mask, as stated in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS; the checker cannot confirm internal effects of this call.
- Assumes synchronize_irq(data->irq) is the required synchronization primitive; other correct strategies may exist but are not enumerated in the provided materials.
- Scope focuses on the fxls8962af driver pattern evidenced by PATCH_DIFF, FUNCTION_CONTENT, and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS; generalization to other drivers may need additional subsystem knowledge not provided.
