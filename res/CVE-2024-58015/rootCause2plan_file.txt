1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence to define a vulnerability-specific checker for CVE-2024-58015; provide a generic, patch-diff-driven detection methodology template pending actual [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Determine the exact vulnerability class and fix pattern. Signals — Extract added/removed conditions, parameter validations, bounds checks, lock/unlock pairs, null/error checks, or privilege/authorization checks from [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — None possible until [PATCH_DIFF] is available.

2) Step 2: Objective — Identify the vulnerable sinks or operations modified by the patch. Signals — Calls or operations wrapped by newly added guards, changed function signatures, or replaced APIs shown in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Restrict to exact pre-patch sink usage patterns that were touched by the patch.

3) Step 3: Objective — Infer the missing precondition or invariant enforced by the patch. Signals — New comparisons, range checks, capability checks, reference/ownership checks, or state predicates surrounding the sink as per [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]. FP mitigation — Require the same predicate to be absent on pre-patch paths.

4) Step 4: Objective — Model the pre-patch unsafe path. Signals — Control-flow paths reaching the sink without the newly introduced guard or with a weaker version of it. FP mitigation — Verify reachability and satisfiability of the path with typical assumptions (no contradictory conditions).

5) Step 5: Objective — Identify sources/taint contributing to the unsafe condition (if data-dependent). Signals — Inputs, untrusted parameters, user-controlled fields, deserialized data, or environment-derived values that feed the sink or guard expression (based on [FILE_CONTENT]/[PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation — Limit to flows not sanitized by the newly added validation functions from [PATCH_DIFF].

6) Step 6: Objective — Capture resource/lifecycle violations if the patch adds ordering (locks, refs, frees). Signals — Added lock/unlock, ref-count inc/dec, open/close, or state transitions bracketing the sink. FP mitigation — Require prior absence of that ordering on at least one feasible path.

7) Step 7: Objective — Capture error-handling fixes. Signals — Newly added return-value checks, null checks, or error propagation around API calls. FP mitigation — Ensure the API is documented (in code) to return errors and that the pre-patch path used the value without checking.

8) Step 8: Objective — Encode equivalence of “fixed state” vs. “vulnerable state.” Signals — Compare expressions in added conditions to variables used by the sink (same operands, aliases). FP mitigation — Require semantic aliasing (same variable/field, or same dereference chain) rather than textual similarity.

9) Step 9: Objective — Restrict analysis to the relevant versions and files. Signals — Files/functions touched by [PATCH_DIFF] and historical versions before the fix. FP mitigation — Scope to exact modules/namespaces/packages where the diff applies.

10) Step 10: Objective — Validate that the sink is externally reachable (if applicable). Signals — Public/exposed entry points, request handlers, RPCs calling into the vulnerable function. FP mitigation — Require at least one call chain from an entry point with compatible argument types.

11) Step 11: Objective — Prioritize high-confidence matches. Signals — Paths where all added guards from [PATCH_DIFF] are missing, not just some. FP mitigation — Rank lower when partial guards are present or alternative mitigations exist.

12) Step 12: Objective — Exclude obviously safe patterns. Signals — Equivalent guard expressed differently (e.g., helper function that encapsulates the check) present pre-patch. FP mitigation — Recognize semantic equivalence via dataflow to helper validations.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch.
- Call sites of APIs that gained new checks or wrappers.
- Condition checks added in [PATCH_DIFF] (null, bounds, range, capability, state).
- Locking and lifecycle boundaries (lock/unlock, ref inc/dec, open/close).
- Function return-value uses and their error-checking patterns.
- Allocation/deallocation sites around the changed code.
- Entry points that reach the modified sinks.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from entry points and external/untrusted inputs to the patched sinks.
- Track whether values passing into sinks are validated by newly added checks; flag flows that bypass such validation.
- Track resource/state transitions added by the patch; flag paths where the transition does not precede the sink.
- Model return values of critical APIs to see if they are used without the newly added error/null checks.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch version where a sink is invoked without the guard/check introduced by the patch, with a feasible path from an entry point supplying attacker-controlled data.
- Negative: Post-patch version where the same path includes the added guard/check or proper resource ordering; also a pre-patch case that already had an equivalent guard via a helper function.
- Test harness notes: Run the checker on both pre- and post-patch revisions identified in [PATCH_DIFF] to confirm disappearance of alerts after the fix and stability on unrelated code.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — depends on availability of [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] to crystallize the specific guard/sink patterns; implementation effort increases if lifecycle and taint modeling are required.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically equivalent validations expressed via helpers not recognized — mitigate by alias/summary modeling for common helpers identified in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FILE_CONTENT].
- Infeasible control-flow paths — mitigate with basic path feasibility checks and condition contradiction pruning.
- Alternative mitigations (e.g., upstream sanitization) — mitigate by requiring that validation dominates the sink along all paths, or by modeling known sanitizers from the patch context.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] provided; the exact vulnerability class, sinks, and guards are unknown.
- Assumes the fix adds explicit code-level artifacts (checks, ordering, or API changes) that can be pattern-matched.
- Cannot define concrete function names, APIs, or specific dataflow sources/sanitizers without the missing materials.
- Validation examples are conceptual and must be instantiated once the patch details are available.
