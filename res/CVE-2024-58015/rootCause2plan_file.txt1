1. Plan Summary
Insufficient information is provided to characterize the vulnerability; no detection plan can be defined without PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS details.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Determine feasibility — Signals: The required evidence (patch description/diff, file contents, or root-cause analysis) is missing, so no concrete AST or semantic pattern can be derived to target the vulnerability class.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS were supplied; there is no evidence to identify the vulnerability type, APIs, sinks, sources, or control/data-flow patterns.
- Without concrete indicators (affected language, frameworks, function names, data types, or code constructs), any proposed detection logic would be speculative and risk false results.
- A meaningful plan requires at least one of: vulnerable code snippet, patch diff with changed lines, or a narrative root cause describing the bug pattern and remediation.
