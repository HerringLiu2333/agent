1. Plan Summary
Detect kernel allocation sites that grow buffers based on current size (e.g., doubling) under an “insufficient capacity” condition, where kzalloc/kmalloc is called without __GFP_NOWARN and there is no evident upper bound check, leading to warn_alloc-driven log flooding and potential DoS.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify kernel allocation calls that can emit warn_alloc. Signals: Calls to kzalloc/kmalloc-like allocators with a GFP flag expression that does not include __GFP_NOWARN (based on [PATCH_DIFF] change to add __GFP_NOWARN). FP mitigation: Restrict to GFP-flagged kernel allocators and exclude known user-space allocation wrappers.

2) Step 2: Objective: Find growth-style size computations. Signals: Allocation size computed from an existing “capacity/size” variable by multiplying by a factor >1 or by a left shift (e.g., len = writebuf_size * 2 per [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation: Require that the size expression references the same capacity variable used elsewhere in the function (not a constant-only expression).

3) Step 3: Objective: Ensure the allocation is triggered by an insufficient-capacity condition. Signals: A guarding condition comparing a “used/avail” value against a “capacity/size” minus a small constant (e.g., avail >= writebuf_size - 1 as in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation: Require the growth allocation to be control-dependent on this condition in the same function.

4) Step 4: Objective: Confirm absence of an explicit upper bound check before allocation. Signals: No prior condition in the same path that constrains the new size against KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE or a fixed threshold (32KB mentioned in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]) or caps the line length. FP mitigation: Search along the dominating path for checks like “new_size > cap ⇒ return/error” or clamping constructs; if present, do not flag.

5) Step 5: Objective: Strengthen link between size computation and capacity variable. Signals: Dataflow from a recognized capacity variable (e.g., writebuf_size) into the computed allocation size (len), then into the allocator argument (as in [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation: Require a direct dataflow edge from capacity to allocation size, not via unrelated arithmetic unrelated to buffer management.

6) Step 6: Objective: Recognize repeated growth patterns indicative of potential log flooding. Signals: The growth allocation appears in a loop or in a code path that can be re-entered upon repeated input (e.g., a writer/line-accumulator function per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] “write very long line without newline”). FP mitigation: If no loop or re-entry path is detectable, lower the confidence but still consider if steps 2–4 strongly match.

7) Step 7: Objective: Detect reliance on natural failure without noise suppression. Signals: Post-allocation failure branch sets error = -ENOMEM or returns -ENOMEM (as shown in [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]) with no __GFP_NOWARN. FP mitigation: Treat this as a boosting signal rather than mandatory to avoid missing variants.

8) Step 8: Objective: Exclude cases already suppressing warn_alloc. Signals: Flags include __GFP_NOWARN (as per [PATCH_DIFF] fix). FP mitigation: If present anywhere in the flags expression, do not report.

9) Step 9: Objective: Exclude cases where growth is small and bounded. Signals: Detect min()/clamp() or if-guards ensuring capacity cannot exceed a small constant (e.g., <= 32KB per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] discussion). FP mitigation: If a tight cap is evident in the same function and dominates the allocation, do not report.

3. Target Elements
- Function bodies handling input accumulation or buffer writes.
- Allocation call sites: kzalloc/kmalloc (and kernel allocators with GFP flags).
- Size computation expressions feeding allocators.
- Guarding condition checks comparing used/avail vs capacity.
- Failure handling blocks (e.g., returning -ENOMEM).
- Local variables representing capacity (e.g., writebuf_size) and used/avail counters.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from a capacity variable into the computed allocation size (len) and into the allocator’s size argument.
- Track control dependence from an “insufficient capacity” condition to the growth allocation site.
- Optionally, track re-entrant paths via loops or repeated calls to the same function to indicate repeated growth potential.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Function with if (used >= cap - 1) { new_cap = cap * 2; buf = kzalloc(new_cap, GFP_NOFS); if (!buf) return -ENOMEM; } without any upper bound check and without __GFP_NOWARN — should be flagged.
- Negative: Same as above but allocator flags include GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOWARN — should not be flagged.
- Negative: Same growth pattern but with a preceding if (new_cap > KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE) return -EINVAL; — should not be flagged.
- Negative: Allocation with fixed small cap enforced via clamp(new_cap, ..., 32768) — should not be flagged.
- Test harness notes: Ensure control-dependence and dataflow analyses can connect the guard condition, capacity variable, and allocation site within the same function.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Growth allocations in non-reentrant or single-shot initialization paths; mitigate by requiring guard pattern and, if detectable, loop/re-entry presence.
- Cases with caps enforced in callers; mitigate by restricting to intra-procedural caps and documenting limitation.
- Allocations where warn_alloc noise is acceptable by design; mitigate by focusing on input-driven growth conditions and absence of caps.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Privilege level and interface exposure (how user input reaches the path) are not determinable (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Thresholds like “32KB” and constants like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE may be macro-defined and not trivially resolvable by the checker in all build contexts.
- The checker assumes kernel-style GFP-flagged allocators; coverage of other allocators is out of scope unless they take GFP flags.
