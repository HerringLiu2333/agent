1. Plan Summary
Detect kernel allocation sites in user-driven input loops that grow buffers (e.g., doubling size) without the __GFP_NOWARN flag, enabling user-triggerable allocator WARN splats leading to DoS (as in tomoyo_write_control).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify functions that read user-controlled data. Signals: function parameters with __user pointers or calls to get_user/copy_from_user (based on FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: Require that the user buffer is used in the function’s main control flow (not merely passed through).

2) Step 2: Objective: Locate loops that consume user input until a delimiter. Signals: loops that repeatedly read bytes/chars and only break on a newline check (e.g., if (c != '\n') continue) as shown in FUNCTION_CONTENT. FP mitigation: Require actual comparison with '\n' or equivalent end-of-line logic.

3) Step 3: Objective: Detect buffer-full growth checks inside the loop. Signals: condition comparing an “available/used” counter against a “buffer size” minus small constant (e.g., avail >= size - 1) per FUNCTION_CONTENT. FP mitigation: Ensure both variables are associated with the same buffer object used for writes in the loop.

4) Step 4: Objective: Find reallocation triggered by the growth check. Signals: computation of a new length from the current size via arithmetic growth, especially multiplication by 2 (len = size * 2) (FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: Require that the computed length is passed to an allocator call immediately following the check.

5) Step 5: Objective: Confirm reallocation pattern to tie allocation to buffer growth. Signals: sequence of allocate → copy/memmove old content → free old buffer → reassign pointer → update size (FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: Require at least two of these post-allocation actions (copy and reassignment) before flagging.

6) Step 6: Objective: Inspect allocation flags for missing __GFP_NOWARN. Signals: kmalloc/kzalloc calls with GFP_* flags that do not include __GFP_NOWARN (PATCH_DIFF shows the fix adds this flag). FP mitigation: Ignore allocations already using __GFP_NOWARN.

7) Step 7: Objective: Assess user-repeatability of the allocation path. Signals: allocation site is inside a loop whose continuation depends on not encountering a newline from user input (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS trigger condition). FP mitigation: Require that the loop condition/continuation is influenced by user-sourced values (tracked via Step 1 and Step 2).

8) Step 8: Objective: Prioritize cases with exponential growth likely to reach large sizes. Signals: multiplicative growth (e.g., size * 2) rather than constant increments, as in FUNCTION_CONTENT. FP mitigation: Lower severity or suppress when growth is constant or bounded by a small cap.

9) Step 9: Objective: Detect absence of a pre-allocation upper bound check. Signals: no guarding condition limiting the new length before the allocator call (e.g., no check against a maximum size) consistent with FUNCTION_CONTENT and PATCH_DESCRIPTION rationale. FP mitigation: If a clear max-size guard exists immediately before allocation, downgrade or suppress the finding.

10) Step 10: Objective: Confirm the allocation failure returns an error without suppressing warns. Signals: allocation checked for NULL and sets error = -ENOMEM; break (FUNCTION_CONTENT), but without __GFP_NOWARN this can emit WARN splats (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Ensure the error path exists; still flag due to WARN risk absent NOWARN.

11) Step 11: Objective: Exclude non-user-triggerable code paths. Signals: allocation within loops not influenced by __user or copy_from_user/get_user should be excluded. FP mitigation: Require a dataflow link from the __user buffer read to the loop logic that can repeatedly reach the allocation.

12) Step 12: Objective: Report with context. Signals: include the allocation call, growth expression, and evidence of user-driven loop termination on newline (from FUNCTION_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Only report when all core signals (Steps 1,2,3,4,6) are satisfied.

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions with __user parameters.
- Calls to get_user/copy_from_user.
- Loop constructs consuming input and checking for newline.
- Conditionals comparing used/available counters to buffer size.
- Allocation call sites (kzalloc/kmalloc) inside those loops.
- Arithmetic expressions computing new allocation size from current buffer size.
- Post-allocation copy/free/reassign sequences.
- Allocation flag argument expressions.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track taint from __user parameters and get_user/copy_from_user reads into variables used in loop continuation and buffer write indices.
- Establish reachability from user-controlled loop iterations to the allocation site, confirming repeated triggerability.
- Associate the “avail” counter and “buffer size” with the same buffer instance being written by tainted input.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch tomoyo_write_control where kzalloc(len, GFP_NOFS) is called in a user-driven loop, growing buffer by doubling without __GFP_NOWARN (FUNCTION_CONTENT, PATCH_DIFF).
- Negative: Post-patch tomoyo_write_control where the same allocation includes __GFP_NOWARN (PATCH_DIFF).
- Negative: A function that reads from user once and allocates a fixed-size buffer outside any user-controlled loop.
- Negative: A growth allocation in a loop with a strict upper bound check that prevents large sizes and/or already includes __GFP_NOWARN.
- Test harness notes: Run on the file security/tomoyo/common.c and verify only the pre-patch pattern is flagged; ensure the same site is cleared in the patched hunk.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Allocations in loops that are not actually user-driven: mitigate by requiring taint from __user input to loop control.
- Growth patterns that are bounded elsewhere: mitigate by scanning for nearby max-size guards and downgrading/suppressing.
- Contexts where WARNs are acceptable: mitigate by focusing on patterns matching ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS (repeated, user-triggerable, newline-terminated input).

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- We assume kzalloc/kmalloc are the relevant allocators; other allocators are not covered due to lack of evidence in provided materials.
- The checker cannot determine runtime kernel settings (e.g., panic_on_warn) or actual maximum allocatable sizes.
- The presence/absence of KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE checks beyond the snippet is unknown; we infer absence only from the provided FUNCTION_CONTENT.
- Privilege context of callers is not evaluated; we assume user writes can reach the function per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
