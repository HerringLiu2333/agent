1. Plan Summary
No PATCH_DIFF/FILE_CONTENT/ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS were provided, so this plan outlines a generic, diff-driven CodeQL detection approach to capture pre-patch flaws once the missing information is available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — derive the vulnerability’s syntactic/semantic pattern from the patch; Conceptual signals — identify constructs introduced by the patch (e.g., new guards, validations, error handling, synchronization) and the code elements they wrap; FP mitigation — confirm changes are directly tied to security by correlating to commit message/CVE tag when available. (Blocked pending missing PATCH_DIFF/PATCH_DESCRIPTION.)
2) Step 2: Objective — characterize the “missing before” condition; Conceptual signals — formulate the absence pattern: the same call/dataflow/operation occurring without the newly added protective condition; FP mitigation — require structural similarity (same callee/operands/receiver and location context). (Blocked without PATCH_DIFF.)
3) Step 3: Objective — enumerate sources and sinks implicated; Conceptual signals — from the patch, list the inputs checked (sources) and sensitive operations (sinks) such as memory access, file/network I/O, privilege changes; FP mitigation — limit to the same modules/files/functions touched by the patch. (Needs PATCH_DIFF/FILE_CONTENT.)
4) Step 4: Objective — define the guard predicate semantics; Conceptual signals — model the boolean condition(s) added (e.g., null/bounds/authorization/state checks) and the scope they protect; FP mitigation — require dominance/post-dominance relation between guard and sink. (Needs patch to know the condition form.)
5) Step 5: Objective — detect pre-guard sink usage; Conceptual signals — flag paths where the sink is reachable without the equivalent guard dominating; FP mitigation — allow known safe equivalents (e.g., earlier checks, helper wrappers) by matching semantically equivalent predicates.
6) Step 6: Objective — track dataflow from sources to sinks; Conceptual signals — define taint or value flow from identified sources through transformations to the sink operations introduced in Step 3; FP mitigation — require flows to be feasible under type and interprocedural call-graph constraints.
7) Step 7: Objective — capture API misuse corrected by patch; Conceptual signals — if patch adds return-value checking, detect calls lacking required result/error checks; FP mitigation — exclude calls where surrounding control flow ensures safety (e.g., exceptions, assertions).
8) Step 8: Objective — capture lifetime/concurrency fixes; Conceptual signals — if patch introduces locking, reference counting, or ordering, detect code regions operating on shared state without required synchronization or after release; FP mitigation — require the same resource/object identity and thread-shared context.
9) Step 9: Objective — localize to version ranges; Conceptual signals — scope analysis to pre-patch revisions (if VCS metadata available) to reduce spurious hits on already-fixed code; FP mitigation — ignore files/lines with the patch hunk already applied.
10) Step 10: Objective — incorporate module/context filtering; Conceptual signals — limit to packages/namespaces implicated by the patch to avoid cross-project overgeneralization; FP mitigation — require filename or namespace match from patch metadata.
11) Step 11: Objective — validate equivalence of guard patterns; Conceptual signals — accept alternative safe constructs (e.g., helper function that encapsulates the guard); FP mitigation — maintain a whitelist of safe wrappers inferred from the patch diff.
12) Step 12: Objective — rank findings; Conceptual signals — prioritize alerts that exactly match the pre-patch pattern (same API, same path shape) over approximate matches; FP mitigation — downgrade heuristic-only matches.

3. Target Elements
- Functions, methods, and their call sites related to the patched regions.
- Condition checks/guards added by the patch and their dominance over sensitive operations.
- Allocation sites, deallocation sites, and lifetime transitions if the patch suggests lifetime bugs.
- Synchronization primitives (locks, atomics) and critical sections if the patch introduces them.
- Function return-value uses and error-handling branches added by the patch.
- Input parsing/validation logic and downstream sink invocations.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from inputs identified in the patch (parameters, environment, I/O) to sinks that were newly guarded.
- Model value constraints introduced by the patch guards (e.g., non-null, bounds) and detect paths where sinks are reached without those constraints.
- Follow interprocedural flows across the same call graph edges appearing in the patched code, preserving object/receiver identity when relevant.
- Treat wrapper functions added by the patch as sanitizers/validators; report when sinks are reached without passing through them.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal pre-patch snippet replicating the vulnerable pattern (same API call or sink without the guard/error check/sync the patch adds); expect a finding.
- Negative: The same snippet with the guard/error check/sync as in the patch applied; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Because no concrete patch is available, create surrogate tests once PATCH_DIFF is known; ensure tests mirror the exact condition and sink relationships.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — precise checker design depends on unavailable PATCH_DIFF/FILE_CONTENT/ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS; effort is driven by reverse-engineering the concrete pattern once provided.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative safe patterns not identical to the patch guard; mitigate by recognizing semantically equivalent checks and safe wrappers.
- Context-mismatched calls (same API but different safety requirements); mitigate by constraining to modules/files from the patch and requiring similar control/dataflow context.
- Infeasible paths due to missing interprocedural modeling; mitigate by requiring dominance/post-dominance and feasible value constraints.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS are missing, so no CVE-specific pattern can be specified.
- The plan assumes the patch introduces a recognizable guard/validation/lifetime/synchronization change that can be contrasted against pre-patch code.
- Without concrete sources/sinks/guards, test cases and detection rules remain placeholders to be instantiated once the missing materials are available.
