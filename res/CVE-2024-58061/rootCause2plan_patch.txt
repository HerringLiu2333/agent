1. Plan Summary
Derive and detect the absence of a defensive precondition or sanitization that the (missing) patch presumably introduced; flag pre-patch code paths that reach the same sensitive operation without an equivalent guard.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — establish the vulnerability construct; conceptual signals — identify, when available, what the patch added (e.g., a check, sanitization, or change in call sequence) as the guard predicate G and the protected operation O — FP mitigation — none possible without patch/root-cause details; this step is deferred due to missing [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
2) Step 2: Objective — model the protected operation O; conceptual signals — define O as the sink-like operation that the patch guarded (e.g., dereference, array access, security-sensitive call, arithmetic) once identified — FP mitigation — scope O to the exact APIs/operations introduced or modified by the patch to avoid over-broad matching.
3) Step 3: Objective — model the guard predicate G; conceptual signals — interpret newly added conditions, validations, or sanitizers (e.g., null/bounds/range/authentication/type checks) as G that must dominate O — FP mitigation — treat only syntactically/semantically equivalent checks to those introduced by the patch as G.
4) Step 4: Objective — find occurrences of O across the codebase; conceptual signals — collect all call sites/expressions matching O’s signature or operation pattern, including variants and wrappers — FP mitigation — exclude sites that are inside the exact patched regions to avoid flagging already-fixed instances.
5) Step 5: Objective — check dominance of G before O; conceptual signals — analyze control flow to ensure that, along all paths to O, a check equivalent to G occurs and dominates O — FP mitigation — treat multiple-path dominance precisely; do not flag when any path is impossible or when G is enforced by earlier function contracts.
6) Step 6: Objective — detect missing or insufficient guards; conceptual signals — flag paths that reach O without a preceding G, or with a weaker/non-equivalent check (e.g., partial range coverage, wrong variable, missing return-value check) — FP mitigation — require semantic equivalence to G (same variables/fields, same comparison bounds, same return-value interpretation).
7) Step 7: Objective — account for interprocedural enforcement; conceptual signals — propagate G through calls: if caller enforces G and callee performs O, consider the guard satisfied when dataflow preserves the guarded value — FP mitigation — restrict to straightforward dataflow without aliasing ambiguity; require that the same value/parameter is guarded.
8) Step 8: Objective — identify sanitizer patterns as alternatives to G; conceptual signals — recognize transformations inserted by the patch (e.g., clamping, copying into bounded buffers) that render O safe even without an explicit condition — FP mitigation — only accept sanitizers that match the added patch constructs; ignore generic or unrelated transformations.
9) Step 9: Objective — handle error-handling patterns from the patch; conceptual signals — require that when G fails, the code follows the same error path introduced by patch (e.g., early return, goto cleanup), and flag sites that “check but continue” into O — FP mitigation — demand identical or stricter post-check control flow outcomes to avoid flagging benign logs or metrics.
10) Step 10: Objective — refine with contextual constraints; conceptual signals — incorporate any constants, feature flags, or configuration gates that the patch used around G/O — FP mitigation — mirror those constraints to avoid reporting contexts where the vulnerable path is unreachable.
11) Step 11: Objective — deduplicate and rank; conceptual signals — group results by function and O kind, prioritize those identical to patched locations but lacking G — FP mitigation — suppress duplicates and library-generated code.
12) Step 12: Objective — produce actionable traces; conceptual signals — for each finding, emit a path from entry to O showing absence of G — FP mitigation — only include minimal, precise traces that demonstrate the missing guard.

3. Target Elements
- Condition checks and sanitization constructs added by the patch (G) — when available.
- Sensitive operations (O): dereferences, array indexing, arithmetic on untrusted/unchecked values, security-sensitive API calls.
- Function call sites, return-value uses (e.g., error checks), allocation and copy/move sites, boundary checks.
- Lock/permission/context checks if the patch added such guards.
- Control-flow structures dominating O; interprocedural call boundaries where G may be enforced.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track values guarded by G to their use at O, ensuring the same variable/field/parameter reaches O without mutation that would invalidate G.
- Interprocedural propagation of guard satisfaction from caller to callee when parameters are directly passed through.
- Recognize sanitization flows introduced by the patch (e.g., clamping length before memcpy), and treat sanitized outputs as safe.
- Distinguish separate values to avoid transferring G from unrelated variables.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function performs O (e.g., dereference/copy/privileged call) without any prior check/sanitization equivalent to G; the checker flags it with a path lacking G.
- Negative: The same O executed only after an explicit check/sanitizer identical to the patch’s G, with correct error handling; the checker reports nothing.
- Test harness notes: Include interprocedural cases where the caller enforces G; include a case with a weaker, non-equivalent check to ensure it is still flagged.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires modeling of guard equivalence, control-flow dominance, and basic interprocedural dataflow once the patch-defined G and O are known.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Implicit invariants (e.g., constructor-established guarantees) not modeled — mitigate by allowing annotations or whitelisting known safe constructors/wrappers.
- Over-approximated dataflow/aliasing causing missed recognition of G — mitigate by requiring straightforward, same-variable flows.
- Semantically similar but not textually identical checks — mitigate by defining equivalence based on variables, ranges, and return-value semantics from the patch, not on syntax alone.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No details about the root cause, patch, or diff are available (as indicated by missing [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]), so O and G cannot be concretely specified.
- The plan assumes the patch added explicit guards/sanitizers around a sensitive operation; if the fix is of a different nature (e.g., algorithmic rewrite), this approach must be revised.
- Equivalence of guards depends on the eventual patch semantics; without them, only a template methodology can be provided.
