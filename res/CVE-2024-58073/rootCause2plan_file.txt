1. Plan Summary
Detect pre-patch code paths that lack the validation/guarding behavior introduced by the fix for CVE-2024-58073.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — derive the fix’s semantic signals (added guards, sanitizers, API substitutions, protocol/lock checks). Conceptual signals — compare pre/post conditions, newly added conditionals, error checks, or API changes from the patch; map them to a reusable “guard predicate”. FP mitigation — none possible here; no [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION] provided to specialize signals.
2) Step 2: Objective — identify the sink operations whose use is conditioned by the new guard. Conceptual signals — calls/operations directly enclosed by the added checks in the patch or immediately after changed API returns; treat them as “sinks”. FP mitigation — restrict to those exact APIs/operations seen changed/guarded in the patch once available; currently blocked by missing [PATCH_DIFF].
3) Step 3: Objective — model the guard predicate(s) introduced by the patch as a boolean condition or protocol step. Conceptual signals — specific comparisons, null checks, bounds checks, authorization checks, state/lock acquisitions added around the sink in the patch. FP mitigation — require structural equivalence (same operands/APIs) to the patch-introduced checks to avoid overmatching unrelated conditions.
4) Step 4: Objective — find code paths reaching the sink without the guard predicate. Conceptual signals — control-flow from function entry to sink lacking a dominating instance of the guard predicate; track across basic blocks and simple inlining of wrappers. FP mitigation — require dominance or post-dominance properties that match the patch structure; exclude paths where an equivalent or stronger guard holds.
5) Step 5: Objective — detect unchecked/ignored return values when the patch adds error handling. Conceptual signals — functions whose return values begin to be checked/propagated in the patch; pre-patch call sites ignoring or not testing the result. FP mitigation — only flag for the exact functions newly checked in the patch and only when the surrounding context matches (no intervening check).
6) Step 6: Objective — detect unsafe API usage replaced by a safer alternative in the patch. Conceptual signals — API substitution patterns (old → new) indicated by the patch; pre-patch uses of the old API without compensating guards/sanitization. FP mitigation — suppress if equivalent safety checks surround the old API use or if the safer API is not available in that context.
7) Step 7: Objective — enforce resource/state protocols when the patch adds missing steps (e.g., lock, init, bounds setup). Conceptual signals — newly added protocol steps before/after the sink; pre-patch paths invoking the sink without those steps in the required order. FP mitigation — require the exact protocol sequence as per the patch and limit analysis to the same functions/files touched.
8) Step 8: Objective — track tainted or unvalidated inputs reaching the sink when the patch adds validation. Conceptual signals — inputs from parameters, external data, or returns that the patch starts validating; pre-patch flows from those sources into the sink without passing through the new validator. FP mitigation — constrain sources/sanitizers to those identified in the patch; treat the new check as a sanitizer and exclude flows that pass through it.
9) Step 9: Objective — detect missing boundary/length checks if the patch adds comparisons/arithmetic guards. Conceptual signals — arithmetic on sizes/indices or memcpy-like copies that, post-patch, are guarded by a bound; pre-patch occurrence of the same operation without the bound. FP mitigation — require the exact comparison operands introduced by the patch; ignore if a different but stronger invariant is present.
10) Step 10: Objective — identify changes to privilege/feature flags guarding operations. Conceptual signals — patch adds role/flag gating conditions; pre-patch code executes sensitive operation without such gating. FP mitigation — only consider the specific flags/roles added by the patch; exclude contexts where equivalent capability checks already exist.
11) Step 11: Objective — model interprocedural propagation of the guard when the patch moves checks into helpers. Conceptual signals — helper functions added/modified to perform the check; pre-patch call paths lacking calls to the helper or equivalent checks. FP mitigation — limit to call chains present in files/functions modified by the patch to reduce scope.
12) Step 12: Objective — correlate all findings to the exact locations touched by the patch for confidence. Conceptual signals — pre-patch variants in the same functions/modules where the patch added guards; prioritize identical code patterns. FP mitigation — de-prioritize matches outside patched areas to avoid unrelated matches.

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions and bodies where the patch added conditions or API changes.
- Call sites of APIs that were newly guarded or replaced in the patch.
- Condition checks (if/while/assert), error handling branches, and return-value tests introduced by the patch.
- Resource/lock acquisition and release boundaries added by the patch.
- Allocation and buffer/IO operations guarded by new bounds or validations.
- Function return-value uses where the patch began checking/propagating errors.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from identified sources (parameters/externals) into the patched sinks.
- Treat the patch-added checks or validators as sanitizers; consider flows unsafe when they bypass these.
- Track path conditions to ensure the guard predicate dominates the sink when present.
- Model simple interprocedural flows across wrappers/helpers introduced or modified by the patch.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal example where a sink operation appears without the specific guard/error check/API substitution that the patch introduces; the checker should flag the unguarded path.
- Negative: The same example but with the exact guard predicate or safer API introduced by the patch applied; the checker should not report.
- Test harness notes: Derive concrete APIs/conditions from the actual [PATCH_DIFF]; create unit tests mirroring the pre- and post-patch hunks to validate dominance and taint-through-sanitizer behavior.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — specialization depends on extracting concrete guard/sink patterns from the missing patch; core control-flow/taint modeling is standard.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent but syntactically different guards (mitigate by semantic equivalence checks once guard semantics are known).
- Contexts where the sink is safe due to invariants not visible interprocedurally (mitigate by requiring dominance and localized matching to patched regions).
- Alternative safe APIs or wrappers unknown to the model (mitigate by whitelisting known safe wrappers from the patch context).
- Macro-generated conditions obfuscating the guard (mitigate by expanding known macros from patched files).

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the plan cannot specify concrete APIs, guards, or sinks for CVE-2024-58073.
- Assumes the fix adds observable semantic signals (guards, error checks, API substitutions, or protocol steps) that can be mirrored in a checker.
- Assumes access to the repository state pre- and post-patch to extract concrete patterns needed to instantiate this plan.
