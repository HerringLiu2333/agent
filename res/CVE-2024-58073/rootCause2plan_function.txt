1. Plan Summary
High-level goal: detect pre-patch code locations that are missing the specific checks, validations, or guarding constructs that the CVE-2024-58073 patch introduces.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Establish scope — derive the set of functions/APIs/files touched by the patch and the exact safeguards added (conditions, validations, locks, error checks) — confine analysis to those program elements to reduce noise. FP mitigation: limit detection to code paths involving the same functions or data types directly referenced in the patch.
2) Step 2: Detect missing condition/guard checks — locate sensitive operations (the statements immediately guarded post-patch) and flag paths that reach those operations without the equivalent preconditions — ensure control-dependence mapping between guard and operation. FP mitigation: require that the guard’s predicate semantically references the same variables/fields used by the sensitive operation.
3) Step 3: Detect missing return-value/error handling — find calls that the patch begins to check (e.g., for null, negative, error codes) and flag uses where their return values are consumed without those checks — correlate the check with subsequent dereferences or state transitions fixed by the patch. FP mitigation: exclude calls documented or modeled as infallible, and require dataflow from the call to a dereference or state change within a bounded scope.
4) Step 4: Detect missing bounds/size validations — identify memory, buffer, or index operations that the patch wraps with size/length checks and flag pre-patch variants lacking equivalent bounds validation — tie the check variables (length, capacity, offset) to the same operands used in the operation. FP mitigation: ignore cases where sizes are compile-time constants proven safe or are validated upstream within the same function via equivalent predicates.
5) Step 5: Detect missing null/resource checks — where the patch adds null checks or resource-validity checks before use, flag uses of those resources without comparable validation — focus on dereferences, handle operations, or lifecycle events. FP mitigation: require that the resource originates from a potentially failing allocator/open call or external input; exclude proven non-null allocations.
6) Step 6: Detect missing lock/synchronization — if the patch adds lock/unlock around shared state, flag accesses/updates to that state lacking synchronization along equivalent paths — model lock boundaries and shared-field references. FP mitigation: exclude cases inside other synchronization constructs; require the same shared field/object identity the patch protects.
7) Step 7: Detect missing capability/permission checks — where the patch introduces privilege checks (e.g., user authentication, mode checks) before performing an operation, flag paths that perform the operation without them — ensure the check predicate references the same identity/permission variable. FP mitigation: ignore operations performed in guaranteed privileged contexts (e.g., clearly annotated internal-only functions).
8) Step 8: Detect unsafe type/format/use conversions — if the patch adds type/format validation (e.g., range/type assertions) before casts or parsing, flag corresponding casts/parses lacking those validations — correlate the specific variable and conversion site. FP mitigation: exclude conversions from trusted sources or compile-time literals proven safe.
9) Step 9: Detect unsafe arithmetic/overflow checks — where the patch adds arithmetic overflow/underflow guards before allocation or index math, flag equivalent arithmetic without those guards — track the operands through to allocation or access. FP mitigation: exclude arithmetic proven safe by constant bounds, and require propagation into allocation or indexing operands.
10) Step 10: Confirm equivalence of the guard semantics — compare pre-patch code against post-patch predicates to ensure the absence is substantive (not a stylistic variation) — treat logically equivalent checks as non-issues. FP mitigation: include a normalization pass over predicates (e.g., De Morgan equivalences) to avoid duplicate or false flags.
11) Step 11: Path feasibility filtering — apply basic feasibility pruning (unreachable paths, impossible conditions) to avoid reporting dead code — ensure the sensitive operation is reachable from function entry under realistic constraints. FP mitigation: use conservative constant propagation and simple path condition analysis.
12) Step 12: Report only closest-to-sink missing safeguards — emit findings at the nearest operation site the patch protects, with trace to the input or call causing risk — avoid duplicate reports for upstream callers. FP mitigation: collapse multiple upstream missing checks into a single representative sink finding.

3. Target Elements
- Functions, files, and APIs modified by the CVE-2024-58073 patch.
- Sensitive operations added or newly guarded in the patch (dereferences, buffer writes/reads, allocations, state changes).
- Condition checks, error handling blocks, and guard predicates introduced by the patch.
- Call sites of functions whose return values are newly validated.
- Lock boundaries and shared-state accesses the patch protects.
- Arithmetic/length computations used in allocations or indexing that the patch bounds-checks.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track data/control dependence between newly added checks and the protected operations to detect their absence pre-patch.
- Track flows from potentially failing calls or external inputs to sensitive sinks (dereferences, allocations, state mutations).
- Model lock state across function bodies and control edges to detect unsynchronized accesses to protected fields.
- Propagate arithmetic operands from inputs through computations into allocation sizes or indices to find missing overflow/bounds guards.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch snippet that performs a buffer write using a length derived from input without a bounds check, and no error/null checks before dereference that the patch later adds; expect a finding at the write/dereference.
- Negative: A post-patch (or corrected) snippet where the same operation is guarded by explicit length and null checks (and lock if applicable); expect no findings.
- Test harness notes: Construct minimal functions reflecting the added guard types (condition checks, return-value validations, locks) and verify the checker flags only the unguarded variants within the scoped APIs.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: requires mapping patch-added constructs to pre-patch absence and moderate control/dataflow modeling.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Logically equivalent guards expressed differently; mitigate with predicate equivalence normalization.
- Upstream validations not recognized within function scope; mitigate by intra-procedural data/control dependence checks and conservative interprocedural summaries if available.
- Calls that are infallible or resources proven non-null; mitigate via library models and simple value reasoning.
- Synchronization via alternative primitives; mitigate by recognizing common lock APIs and annotating known synchronization wrappers.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are missing, so specific vulnerable patterns, function names, and exact safeguards cannot be enumerated.
- Assumes the patch for CVE-2024-58073 introduces explicit, identifiable checks (conditions, validations, locks) around well-defined sinks; if the fix is a deep architectural change, this plan may not apply.
- Assumes availability of basic control/dataflow and lock-state modeling; exact semantics of APIs involved are unknown without the missing materials.
