1. Plan Summary
Patch-mined static checker that flags code paths invoking the same functionality as the patched site(s) without the newly introduced preconditions, validations, or synchronizations.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify the exact locations, APIs, or code regions modified by the fix; conceptual signals — syntactic additions in [PATCH_DIFF] such as new conditionals, early returns, added checks around a call, or lock operations; FP mitigation — if [PATCH_DIFF] is unavailable (as here), defer enumerating concrete elements and treat this as a parameterized step.
2) Step 2: Objective — Classify the introduced guard(s) by type; conceptual signals — from [PATCH_DIFF], categorize additions as null/initialization check, bounds/length check, integer overflow check, permission/state check, reference-count/lifecycle check, lock acquisition, or return-value validation; FP mitigation — require guard expressions to reference the same variables/operands used by the protected call or dereference.
3) Step 3: Objective — Extract the minimal predicate(s) that the patch enforces; conceptual signals — canonical predicate shapes like v != NULL, i < n, len <= cap, rc > 0, is_authorized(...), or ret >= 0 before a specific sink; FP mitigation — ignore non-safety changes (logging, formatting) and require dominance of the predicate over the sink in the control-flow graph.
4) Step 4: Objective — Find all occurrences of the same sink/API or equivalent code pattern across the codebase; conceptual signals — call sites to the patched function, dereferences/operations on the same data object, or macro-expanded aliases; FP mitigation — normalize indirect calls/wrappers to the same callee and exclude unrelated overloads by matching argument types/roles inferred from [PATCH_DIFF].
5) Step 5: Objective — Verify presence of an equivalent or stronger guard at each occurrence; conceptual signals — enclosing if-conditions, short-circuit boolean checks, assertions, or precondition helpers that imply the same predicate; FP mitigation — consider logical equivalence (e.g., !(v == NULL)), variable aliasing, and folded constants to avoid flagging semantically identical guards.
6) Step 6: Objective — Detect missing or ineffective return-value validation introduced by the patch; conceptual signals — [PATCH_DIFF] shows added comparisons against failure/sentinel values and early returns, so flag call sites that ignore or misuse that return value; FP mitigation — only flag the same callee and require that the return value reaches a use without being checked against the failure domain seen in the patch.
7) Step 7: Objective — Detect synchronization preconditions added by the patch; conceptual signals — added lock/unlock or lock assertions around the sink, implying a required lockset; FP mitigation — compute lockset on paths to the sink and suppress when the lock is provably held due to an earlier wrapper or function contract.
8) Step 8: Objective — Track bounds/length/data-size relationships added by the patch; conceptual signals — new comparisons tying index/length to a size provider or capacity before memory access or copy; FP mitigation — accept alternative checks that constrain the same index/length using the same size provider or a proven upper bound.
9) Step 9: Objective — Track initialization/nullability requirements added by the patch; conceptual signals — new initialization code or null checks before dereference/field use; FP mitigation — suppress when the value originates from an allocator or constructor with a non-null guarantee and no intervening nullifying assignment.
10) Step 10: Objective — Track permission/state gating added by the patch; conceptual signals — added capability checks, feature flags, or state predicates dominating the action; FP mitigation — whitelist wrappers that centralize authorization and prove dominance of equivalent state checks via control-flow.
11) Step 11: Objective — Verify error propagation paths introduced by the patch; conceptual signals — added early returns or error-code propagation on guard failure; FP mitigation — only flag when the function continues execution after a failed guard or discards the error without handling, mirroring the behavior corrected by the patch.
12) Step 12: Objective — Report only genuinely unguarded instances; conceptual signals — aggregate findings by sink and missing predicate signature extracted from [PATCH_DIFF] and require path evidence showing the sink reachable without the guard; FP mitigation — de-duplicate within functions and suppress when an enclosing invariant guarantees the predicate.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and call sites modified or referenced in the fix (from [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Condition checks added by the patch (if-conditions, assertions, early returns).
- Lock acquisition/release or lock assertions near the patched region.
- Function return-value uses and comparisons added by the patch.
- Pointer dereferences, array/indexing expressions, and buffer operations in the patched vicinity.
- Allocation/initialization sites of objects involved in the patched checks.
- State/permission flags and capability checks introduced by the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow of variables appearing in the patched predicates to their use at sinks; require that the same variables or aliases are protected by equivalent predicates on all paths.
- Model dominance: a guard must dominate the sink; short-circuit boolean guards and helper functions that implement the same check should be considered equivalent.
- For return-value checks, track the callee’s return value to its first use and verify comparison against the failure/sentinel domain introduced by the patch.
- For lock requirements, maintain a path-sensitive lockset and ensure the required lock is held on all paths to the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function calling the identified sink/API with no preceding guard/lock/return-value check that matches what the patch introduced; expect a finding.
- Negative: The same call site with the exact guard(s) and error propagation as introduced by the patch dominating the call; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Create minimal pre-patch and post-patch snippets that mimic the added predicate(s) from [PATCH_DIFF], including variants using helper wrappers and equivalent logical forms.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires mining [PATCH_DIFF] to parameterize sinks and guard predicates, plus implementing dominance and limited equivalence reasoning.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative but equivalent guards implemented in helper functions or macros; mitigate by recognizing helper summaries and logical equivalence.
- Implicit invariants ensured by constructors, allocators, or framework lifecycles; mitigate via constructor/allocator models and path pruning.
- Architecture-specific wrappers that enforce checks upstream; mitigate by modeling common wrappers and excluding calls inside their protected regions.
- Overly broad sink matching across overloads or unrelated APIs; mitigate by argument-role matching and type/context constraints from [PATCH_DIFF].

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] contents are missing, so concrete sinks, predicates, and guard categories cannot be enumerated; the plan is a generic patch-mined methodology.
- Assumes the fix adds explicit guards/synchronization/validations rather than deep algorithmic changes; if the patch is a refactor or redesign, this approach may not apply.
- Language, frameworks, and environment are unspecified; the checker will need adaptation once those are known.
