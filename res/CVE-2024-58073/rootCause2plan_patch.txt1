1. Plan Summary
Insufficient information to define a concrete vulnerability class or detection goal because PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS are not provided.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify the precise vulnerability class and its syntactic/semantic footprint from the patch and root-cause materials — e.g., what checks were added/changed, which APIs/paths are implicated, and what invariant was previously missing; these signals are unavailable here.
2) Step 2: Enumerate affected files, functions, and data types by mapping edited locations and referenced symbols in the patch; without the diff, the specific targets cannot be listed.
3) Step 3: Derive the core unsafe pattern by contrasting pre- and post-patch logic to isolate the precondition/guard that was added (or tightened); the concrete guard condition and its scope are unknown.
4) Step 4: Determine relevant sources, sinks, and sanitizers/guards (e.g., inputs, dangerous operations, and required validations) by reading the patch and root-cause narrative; these elements are not determinable from the provided materials.
5) Step 5: Define the interprocedural context requirements (e.g., call chains, configuration flags, object state) based on how the patch propagates checks or state; the needed context cannot be inferred here.
6) Step 6: Establish reporting criteria (what constitutes a missing/insufficient guard before a sensitive operation) from the exact conditions added in the patch; no concrete criteria can be set without the patch details.
7) Step 7: Calibrate exclusions (benign patterns that the patch explicitly allows or documents) to reduce false positives; no exclusion signals are available.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS content is available, so the vulnerability type, affected APIs, and exact patterns cannot be specified.
- The plan cannot define sources, sinks, guards, or reporting conditions without the missing materials.
- Any concrete CodeQL modeling (API lists, data/control-flow patterns, or guard predicates) must be derived once the patch and root-cause details are provided.
