1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence to define a specific vulnerability signature; the plan outlines a placeholder, patch-diff–driven detection strategy pending actual root cause and patch details.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Establish the root-cause characteristics — signals: derive the exact flaw pattern from [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [FUNCTION_CONTENT]; currently not determinable due to missing inputs — FP mitigation: tie all detections to concrete motifs explicitly present in the patch hunks (e.g., specific checks, API usage changes).
2) Step 2: Identify functions or call sites modified by the patch — signals: list of altered functions, newly added guards, or changed API calls from [PATCH_DIFF]; not available here — FP mitigation: scope analysis strictly to those functions and their call-graph neighborhoods to reduce noise.
3) Step 3: Define the “pre-patch flaw” as the absence of the corrective change — signals: absence of exact guard/validation/resource-handling pattern introduced in the patch (e.g., missing condition, missing return-value check) — FP mitigation: require structural similarity (same operands/variables/objects) as in the patch context rather than generic missing checks.
4) Step 4: Constrain by semantic context — signals: same resource types, parameters, and control-flow points as changed in [FUNCTION_CONTENT] (e.g., before/after specific calls, within certain error paths); currently unknown — FP mitigation: exclude unrelated occurrences by enforcing proximity to the exact API or block locations indicated by the patch.
5) Step 5: Model data/control dependencies — signals: data flowing into the patched checks or guards (e.g., user input, length, pointers, permissions) and control paths leading to unsafe usage; specifics unavailable — FP mitigation: require the same variables and edges as shown by the patch rather than broad taint assumptions.
6) Step 6: Detect unsafe use sites that the patch protects — signals: uses of the resource/API without the added validation/locking/bounds handling introduced by the patch — FP mitigation: suppress findings where equivalent validation occurs via helper functions or earlier canonical guards.
7) Step 7: Cross-validate with return-value/error handling — signals: new error handling or early returns added in [PATCH_DIFF] and missing pre-patch — FP mitigation: only flag when the exact error predicate or return-value check is absent.
8) Step 8: Apply path-sensitivity — signals: ensure the report occurs on feasible paths reaching the unsafe use without the new guard; feasibility specifics depend on [FUNCTION_CONTENT] — FP mitigation: disregard paths where alternative guards already dominate the use.
9) Step 9: Restrict to version ranges pre-fix — signals: commit/patch identifiers correlating to vulnerable versions; not available — FP mitigation: optional filter to reduce noise across monorepos or forks.
10) Step 10: Aggregate and rank findings — signals: occurrences matching all required structural and contextual predicates; rank by closeness to patched locations — FP mitigation: deprioritize cases with partial match only.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods changed by the patch and their call sites.
- Condition checks and guards introduced by the patch.
- Function return-value uses where checks were added.
- Resource lifecycle sites (allocation/acquisition, use, release) affected by the patch.
- Lock boundaries or concurrency primitives if the patch introduces them.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow of variables/values referenced by the new checks in the patch to their use sites.
- Constrain flows to the same APIs or resource types modified in the patch.
- Require the absence of the specific guard/validation on paths to the use site, matching patch-added predicates.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch function lacking the exact guard/check/error handling introduced by the patch, followed by the protected API/resource use; expect a report.
- Negative: A function with the guard/check exactly as per the patch or an equivalent helper-based validation dominating the use; expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Compile minimal examples reflecting the patched motifs (names, conditions, API calls) once [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT] are available; verify path feasibility and guard dominance.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — cannot proceed without the missing [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [FUNCTION_CONTENT]; effort mainly in deriving precise structural motifs from patch artifacts once provided.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Generic “missing check” patterns not tied to the exact patched motif — mitigate by enforcing strict structural match to patch-added constructs.
- Equivalent validations implemented via different helper functions — mitigate by modeling known helper guards identified in [FUNCTION_CONTENT].
- Infeasible paths or dominated guards — mitigate via control-flow/path-sensitivity and dominance checks.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are missing; no concrete signals can be defined.
- Assumes the patch introduces explicit, structurally identifiable changes (guards, checks, API substitutions) that can be matched in code.
- Versioning/commit metadata for scoping is unavailable; the checker cannot currently filter by affected versions.
