1. Plan Summary
Insufficient materials to determine the vulnerability class; the ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS and patch details are missing, so a specialized detection plan cannot be constructed.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — confirm prerequisite inputs are present; signals — check availability of ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS or PATCH_DIFF/PATCH_DESCRIPTION to extract vulnerability type, affected APIs, and guard conditions.
2) Step 2: Objective — derive the vulnerable operation(s) once inputs exist; signals — identify functions/files changed in the patch and the exact operation (e.g., call sites, dereferences, writes, permission checks) that were guarded or modified.
3) Step 3: Objective — model pre-patch unsafe pattern; signals — from the patch/root cause, enumerate missing validations or incorrect assumptions (e.g., missing bounds/NULL/auth checks), and specify the exact AST/semantic pattern that represents “unsafe before patch.”
4) Step 4: Objective — locate candidate occurrences across the codebase; signals — find call sites or constructs matching the vulnerable operation without the added guards/sanitizers introduced by the patch.
5) Step 5: Objective — track data/control dependencies relevant to the flaw; signals — follow dataflow from inputs to the vulnerable sink and ensure the presence/absence of required sanitization or checks as defined in the patch/root cause.
6) Step 6: Objective — apply path pruning based on patch-added guards; signals — treat conditions/validators added in the patch as sanitizers and flag paths reaching the sink when such guards are not present or not effective.
7) Step 7: Objective — refine to the specific context; signals — restrict matches to the same API/class/module scope indicated by the patch (e.g., same receiver type or subsystem), avoiding unrelated patterns.
8) Step 8: Objective — reduce false positives; signals — require evidence that the unsafe operation is reachable and externally influenced as per root cause (e.g., user-controlled input or untrusted state), if such a property is stated in the materials.
9) Step 9: Objective — report findings with actionable context; signals — include the function, location, missing guard(s), and the vulnerable operation mirroring the pre-patch flaw.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS content is provided, so the vulnerability class, sources/sinks, and guard conditions are unknown.
- Assumes future access to detailed patch/root cause to identify precise operations, checks, and sanitizers needed for a specialized detector.
- Cannot determine whether the issue is memory safety, authorization, input validation, concurrency, or other categories without the missing materials.
