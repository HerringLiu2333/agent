1. Plan Summary
Unable to determine the specific vulnerability class due to missing [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; this plan outlines a patch-diff-driven detection approach that derives the pre-patch flaw pattern from the semantic changes introduced by the fix.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Derive the security-relevant semantic deltas from the fix. Conceptual signals — Identify constructs added/modified in [PATCH_DIFF] such as new condition checks, argument sanitization, error handling, locking, or privilege checks. FP mitigation — Constrain subsequent matching to exact or near-exact structural patterns present in the patch hunks.
2) Step 2: Objective — Synthesize the “required preconditions” the patch enforces. Conceptual signals — For each added conditional or guard in [PATCH_DIFF], infer the variable(s), property(ies), or state they validate (e.g., value range, nullness, capability, state flag). FP mitigation — Require that the same variables/expressions and control-flow proximity appear in the candidate sites.
3) Step 3: Objective — Detect pre-patch code paths that perform the sensitive operation without the new preconditions. Conceptual signals — Locate operations/calls/resources that the patch now protects, and report instances where those operations occur without an immediately-dominating equivalent guard. FP mitigation — Enforce dominance/post-dominance relations and exclude sites already guarded by logically equivalent conditions.
4) Step 4: Objective — Capture missing return-value/error handling patterns if the patch adds them. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] adds return-code checks or error propagation around specific calls, flag similar calls where the return value is ignored or error paths are not handled. FP mitigation — Require the same callee identity (or well-defined set) and comparable call context (arguments and receiver).
5) Step 5: Objective — Capture missing bounds/null/size validations if the patch introduces them. Conceptual signals — If the patch adds length, capacity, index-range, or null checks before memory, array, pointer dereference, or copy operations, identify analogous operations lacking those checks. FP mitigation — Demand that the unchecked operation uses the same data sources or algebraically equivalent expressions as in the patch.
6) Step 6: Objective — Capture missing state/permission/lock preconditions if the patch introduces them. Conceptual signals — If new privilege checks, capability gates, state flags, or lock acquisitions precede an operation, locate paths performing the operation without the same check/lock/state. FP mitigation — Ensure the same resource or state variable is involved; exclude paths proven to be protected by equivalent synchronization or authorization.
7) Step 7: Objective — Propagate requirements across call boundaries. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] adds checks inside a callee or tightens its contract, flag callers that rely on the callee but do not enforce the same preconditions before passing inputs. FP mitigation — Match parameter-to-argument mapping and prune when the callee internally revalidates inputs in the pre-patch code.
8) Step 8: Objective — Reduce noise with semantic equivalence and dominance checks. Conceptual signals — Recognize logically equivalent guards (e.g., inverted forms, early returns) and guard hoisting across basic blocks. FP mitigation — Use control-flow dominance and simple logical equivalence to avoid flagging already-validated paths.
9) Step 9: Objective — Scope to relevant files/symbols. Conceptual signals — Limit search to files, functions, and symbols touched in [PATCH_DIFF] and their transitive callers/callees. FP mitigation — Avoid broad, project-wide patterns unrelated to the patched components.
10) Step 10: Objective — Prioritize high-confidence matches. Conceptual signals — Rank findings higher when the sensitive sink and the missing guard exactly mirror the patch’s sink/guard pair; deprioritize looser analogs. FP mitigation — Optionally require both data and control context similarity for default alerts.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch and their transitive callers/callees.
- Call sites of functions wrapped by new checks or error handling in the patch.
- Condition checks added by the patch (null, bounds, state, privilege, feature flags).
- Memory/array/pointer operations that the patch guards.
- Lock/unlock or synchronization boundaries added by the patch.
- Return-value uses and error-propagation branches introduced by the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from inputs validated by newly added checks to the sensitive operations the patch guards.
- Model parameter-to-argument mapping for callees whose contracts were tightened in the patch.
- Track control dependencies: ensure that the sensitive operation is dominated by the new guard in patched code, and detect absence of such dominance pre-patch.
- If the patch adds sanitization/normalization, treat the sanitizer as a barrier and flag uses that reach sinks without passing through it.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal pre-patch snippet that invokes the sensitive operation/call without the newly added guard (as per [PATCH_DIFF]); the checker should flag it.
- Negative: The post-patch snippet showing the same operation guarded by the new checks; the checker should not flag it.
- Test harness notes: Build fixtures that mirror the exact symbols and control/data patterns from [PATCH_DIFF]; include variants with guard hoisting, early returns, and semantically equivalent conditions to verify FP mitigation.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium to high, contingent on the complexity of the semantic changes in [PATCH_DIFF]; higher if interprocedural data/control-flow modeling is required.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically equivalent guards written differently — mitigate with dominance and logical-equivalence checks.
- Alternative sanitizers or validations providing equivalent safety — maintain an allowlist derived from [PATCH_DIFF] and nearby code idioms.
- Contexts where the sink is safe by construction (e.g., constant-safe indices) — prune with simple value-range reasoning and constant folding.
- Defensive wrappers around sinks — treat wrapper functions added in the patch as validators and model them accordingly.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are missing; the exact vulnerability mechanism, sinks, and guards cannot be specified.
- The plan assumes a patch-diff-driven specification of the flaw; without the diff, concrete patterns, symbols, and conditions are undetermined.
- No assumptions are made about language, framework, or subsystem due to absent materials; implementation details must be filled in once the patch content is available.
