1. Plan Summary
No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS were provided, so the exact vulnerability class cannot be determined. This plan outlines a conservative, patch-driven strategy: infer the guard/validation/locking/resource-lifetime pattern added by the fix and flag pre-patch code paths where that pattern is missing.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — establish scope from the fix; Signals — functions/files and code regions altered by the patch (guards added, checks inserted, locking introduced) as would be seen in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — limit analysis to the syntactic/semantic neighborhoods of changed functions and their direct callers/callees.
2) Step 2: Objective — infer the “newly added condition” pattern; Signals — detect added constructs such as null checks, bounds checks, privilege checks, return-value checks, lock acquisitions, reference count updates, or error handling as indicated by [PATCH_DIFF] (not provided); FP mitigation — require consistent insertion across multiple call sites/paths to avoid overfitting to incidental changes.
3) Step 3: Objective — identify missing-guard instances; Signals — locate call sites or code paths invoking the same sink/functionality without the newly added guard/check/lock visible on the path; FP mitigation — prove guard dominance via control-flow (the guard must postdominate entry and dominate the sink) to avoid false alarms where the check exists on all feasible paths.
4) Step 4: Objective — enforce return-value/use checks if the patch added them; Signals — if [PATCH_DIFF] shows added return-value validation (e.g., check for error/sentinel), find uses of that function’s result without equivalent checks before dereference/assumption; FP mitigation — consider function contracts and documented invariants if available (e.g., annotations) to suppress where a wrapper already validates.
5) Step 5: Objective — enforce bounds/length validations if the patch added them; Signals — if the fix adds size/length comparisons before copy/indexing, flag analogous copies/indexing where the size relation is not established; FP mitigation — require that the index/length is data-dependent on potentially untrusted or variable input (based on def-use/dataflow) and no prior strengthening condition exists.
6) Step 6: Objective — enforce null/invalid pointer checks if the patch added them; Signals — pre-dereference null/invalid checks inserted in [PATCH_DIFF]; flag dereferences or member access where equivalent checks are absent; FP mitigation — allow suppression when preceding allocations/constructors provably ensure non-null or where assertions/contracts guarantee validity.
7) Step 7: Objective — enforce locking/atomicity if the patch added synchronization; Signals — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds lock/unlock or atomic ops around shared state accesses, flag other accesses to the same state without equivalent synchronization; FP mitigation — verify thread-shared nature (e.g., global/static/shared object) and that code resides in concurrent contexts to reduce noise.
8) Step 8: Objective — enforce lifetime/error-path cleanups if the patch added them; Signals — added frees/closes/unrefs on failure or exit paths; flag analogous paths where resources are acquired and errors can occur without cleanup; FP mitigation — require feasible error edges and absence of higher-level RAII/auto-clean constructs.
9) Step 9: Objective — enforce input validation if the patch added sanitization; Signals — if [PATCH_DIFF] introduces sanitizers/converters before passing data to sensitive sinks, flag paths from similar sources to the same sinks without sanitization; FP mitigation — only consider flows from externally influenced inputs or API parameters that match the sources in the patch.
10) Step 10: Objective — enforce capability/authorization checks if the patch added them; Signals — presence of new privilege/permission checks before performing an operation; flag operations elsewhere lacking the same precondition; FP mitigation — model context where higher-level guards might already enforce the policy to avoid duplicates.
11) Step 11: Objective — enforce integer range/overflow checks if the patch added them; Signals — added range checks, casts with explicit width handling, or safe arithmetic wrappers; flag arithmetic feeding allocations, indexing, or size calculations lacking equivalent checks; FP mitigation — require that operands can vary with input and results influence memory sizes or offsets.
12) Step 12: Objective — correlate multiple added safeguards as a pattern; Signals — if the patch introduces a sequence (e.g., check A then B then perform C), search for call sites performing C without both A and B; FP mitigation — use control-flow/path reasoning to ensure both checks are absent on at least one feasible path, reducing FPs where checks are split across helpers.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the fix and their direct callers/callees.
- Call sites invoking the affected APIs or performing the same sensitive operations.
- Condition checks (null, bounds, permission, error-code).
- Lock boundaries and synchronization constructs around shared data.
- Resource allocation/deallocation sites and error-exit paths.
- Function return-value uses and dereferences or array/index operations.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from inputs analogous to those guarded by the patch (parameters, external inputs) to the sensitive operations the patch protects.
- Model guard predicates introduced by the patch and require that they dominate the sink; report where data reaches the sink without passing through equivalent predicates.
- Track resource lifetimes: from allocation/open/ref to all exits; ensure cleanup on error paths as introduced by the patch.
- Track synchronization context: from lock acquisition to shared-state access; flag accesses outside protected regions when the patch added protection.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal example where a function performs an operation (e.g., dereference/copy/privileged action) without any of the checks/locks that the patch purportedly added; the checker should flag the missing guard on that path.
- Negative: The same example with the guard/lock/validation added exactly as in the patch; the checker should report nothing.
- Test harness notes: Since no [PATCH_DIFF]/details are provided, construct synthetic variants reflecting each class (null check, bounds check, lock, return-value check, cleanup) to verify the checker’s modular detectors behave as intended.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — effort depends on specializing the generic steps to the actual patterns found in the missing [PATCH_DIFF]; most sub-checks map to standard CodeQL libraries once specifics are known.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Guards implemented in helper/wrapper functions not inlined in naive dominance checks — mitigate by interprocedural guard recognition.
- Contexts where invariants ensure safety (e.g., constructors guaranteeing non-null) — mitigate by recognizing contracts/assertions and must-alias initializations.
- Alternate synchronization regimes (lock-free atomics) — mitigate by modeling atomics as valid protection when the patch uses locks.
- Sanitization-equivalent transformations — mitigate by allowing configurable equivalence sets derived from the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS were provided, so the exact vulnerability type, affected APIs, and guard semantics are unknown.
- The plan assumes the fix added explicit safeguards (checks/locks/cleanups) that can be recognized and mirrored; if the fix is a deep algorithmic change, this approach may not apply.
- Source language(s), framework, and project structure are unspecified; actual implementation requires these to tailor AST patterns and library models.
