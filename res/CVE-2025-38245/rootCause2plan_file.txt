1. Plan Summary
Detect race-prone deregistration patterns where a global mutex is released after removing an object from a shared list but before tearing down its procfs/sysfs entries, while registration creates those entries under the same mutex.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Find subsystems with a global list and mutex pair — signals: a LIST_HEAD and a DEFINE_MUTEX used together in functions that traverse/modify the list (based on FILE_CONTENT: atm_devs and atm_dev_mutex) — FP mitigation: require both to be referenced in multiple functions to treat them as a pair.
2) Step 2: Identify the lookup/duplicate-check function(s) that traverse the list under the mutex — signals: a function that mutex_locks the mutex and iterates the list or calls a helper that iterates the list (as atm_dev_lookup → __atm_dev_lookup) — FP mitigation: ensure the traversal compares a key field and returns a retained/held reference.
3) Step 3: Identify the registration function — signals: while holding the same mutex, it performs a duplicate check using the lookup on the list and then calls procfs/sysfs registration functions (e.g., atm_proc_dev_register, atm_register_sysfs) before adding to the list (based on FILE_CONTENT) — FP mitigation: require both a duplicate-check and at least one procfs/sysfs creation call under the lock.
4) Step 4: Identify the deregistration function — signals: it locks the same mutex, removes the object from the shared list (list_del on the same list), then unlocks before performing teardown calls (atm_unregister_sysfs, atm_proc_dev_deregister) (based on FILE_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS) — FP mitigation: require the same object pointer flows into both list_del and teardown calls.
5) Step 5: Check ordering asymmetry — signals: registration creates procfs/sysfs while the mutex is held, but deregistration tears them down after unlocking (pre-patch pattern described in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS) — FP mitigation: confirm that the same mutex protects registration-side creation.
6) Step 6: Confirm the namespace pairing — signals: the deregistration calls are the obvious counterparts to registration calls (e.g., atm_proc_dev_register ↔ atm_proc_dev_deregister; atm_register_sysfs ↔ atm_unregister_sysfs per FILE_CONTENT) — FP mitigation: only report when at least one create/destroy pair is observed in the two functions.
7) Step 7: Confirm race window potential — signals: unlock occurs immediately after list_del (visibility drop) and before procfs/sysfs teardown; registration’s duplicate check runs under the same mutex and could proceed (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS) — FP mitigation: ensure the unlock dominates the teardown calls in control-flow.
8) Step 8: Exclude fixed patterns — signals: if deregistration holds the mutex across teardown (as intended by PATCH_DESCRIPTION and PATCH_DIFF), do not report — FP mitigation: require the absence of any lock-held region covering the teardown calls.
9) Step 9: Validate involvement in external namespace — signals: teardown calls reach procfs/sysfs layers (e.g., functions named proc_* or sysfs-related per FILE_CONTENT) — FP mitigation: filter out generic resource frees that do not touch procfs/sysfs and are unlikely to trigger duplicate registration warnings.
10) Step 10: Strengthen confidence via life-cycle symmetry — signals: the deregistration function also performs final reference release after teardown (e.g., atm_dev_put), indicating end-of-life; ensure unlock precedes teardown but teardown precedes final put (FILE_CONTENT) — FP mitigation: require this typical life-cycle structure to avoid incidental matches.
11) Step 11: Multi-path robustness — signals: along all feasible paths where list_del happens, check that an unlock-before-teardown path exists (not just a rare error path) — FP mitigation: ignore paths that are gated by immediate error handling that also prevents concurrent registration (if determinable).
12) Step 12: Report with context — signals: include names of the mutex, list, registration/deregistration functions, and the specific create/destroy calls found; explain that the mismatch creates a TOCTOU window (as in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions for registration, deregistration, and lookup helpers.
- Calls to mutex_lock/mutex_unlock on a shared global mutex.
- List operations on a shared global list (list_add/list_add_tail/list_del).
- Calls to procfs/sysfs creation and teardown functions (e.g., atm_proc_dev_register/atm_proc_dev_deregister, atm_register_sysfs/atm_unregister_sysfs).
- Control-flow regions and dominance/post-dominance around lock/unlock and namespace calls.
- Value flow of the object pointer through list and namespace operations.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the specific mutex variable through lock/unlock calls to infer lock-held regions along paths.
- Track the specific list head used in list traversal and list_del/list_add to bind the subsystem state to the mutex.
- Track the device/object pointer from list_del through subsequent teardown calls to ensure same-object lifecycle.
- Pair registration and deregistration namespace calls by name or by commonly recognized procfs/sysfs APIs to assert symmetry.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch net/atm/resources.c where atm_dev_deregister locks, list_del, unlocks, then calls atm_unregister_sysfs and atm_proc_dev_deregister; atm_dev_register creates procfs/sysfs while holding atm_dev_mutex (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, FILE_CONTENT).
- Negative: Post-patch intent where the mutex is held until after atm_proc_dev_deregister/atm_unregister_sysfs (PATCH_DESCRIPTION/PATCH_DIFF), so no unlock-before-teardown path exists.
- Negative: Functions that unlock before teardown but where registration also creates procfs/sysfs outside the lock (not matching the asymmetry) should not be flagged.
- Test harness notes: Run on the provided file to ensure one finding pre-patch; re-run with patched ordering to ensure zero findings.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High: requires interprocedural control-flow reasoning for lock regions, pairing of create/destroy calls, and correlation across registration/deregistration functions.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Subsystems using additional synchronization beyond the identified mutex: mitigate by requiring that the same mutex protects registration’s namespace creation.
- Unrelated frees misidentified as namespace teardown: mitigate by restricting to procfs/sysfs-like APIs or clear create/destroy pairs observed in the same subsystem.
- Rare error-only paths: mitigate by requiring the main (non-error) path to exhibit the unlock-before-teardown sequence.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes procfs/sysfs operations can be identified via recognizable API names or explicit create/destroy pairs (based on FILE_CONTENT and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS); other namespaces are not covered.
- Assumes the same mutex is the intended global serialization primitive for both registration and deregistration (as in atm_dev_mutex per FILE_CONTENT); alternative synchronization schemes are not modeled.
- Does not prove runtime races; infers risk from ordering asymmetry (based on ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- PATCH_DIFF snippet text appears to have a typo in the added line; the intended behavior (holding the mutex until after teardown) is taken from PATCH_DESCRIPTION and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
