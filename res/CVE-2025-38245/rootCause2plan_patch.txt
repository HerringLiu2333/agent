1. Plan Summary
Detect functions that release a shared device mutex too early during deregistration (after removing an object from a shared list but before tearing down procfs/sysfs), while the corresponding registration path performs duplicate checks under the same mutex and then creates procfs/sysfs, creating a race window (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify candidate deregistration functions — look for function names containing “deregister”, “unregister”, or “remove” that accept a device-like pointer and call a mutex lock/unlock pair — this focuses on teardown paths where locking discipline matters (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 2,5).
2) Step 2: Within such functions, detect a critical section that includes a call removing the device from a shared registry (e.g., list_del on a dev_list field) while holding a specific mutex variable — this matches the shared state update cited (list_del(&dev->dev_list)) in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 4(2).
3) Step 3: Check for an unlock of the same mutex immediately after the registry removal and before any calls that teardown sysfs/procfs — this early unlock is the root cause (premature unlock) per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3.
4) Step 4: Confirm that subsequent calls in the same function perform procfs/sysfs teardown (e.g., function names mentioning “proc”, “sysfs”, or “unregister” like atm_proc_dev_deregister/atm_unregister_sysfs) outside the mutex-protected region — maps to the non-atomic state transition in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3–5.
5) Step 5: Find a corresponding registration function in the same module/prefix (e.g., same file or name prefix) whose name contains “register” or “create” — reduce FPs by correlating deregistration with its registration counterpart (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3).
6) Step 6: In the registration function, verify that it acquires the same mutex variable and performs a duplicate lookup under that lock (e.g., calls a function with “lookup” in the name or iterates over the same list) — reflects __atm_dev_lookup() under atm_dev_mutex in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3.
7) Step 7: Also in the registration function, verify that it calls procfs/sysfs creation routines (e.g., names containing “proc_create”, “proc_register”, “sysfs_create”) after the lookup while still under the mutex or before unlocking — mirrors the sequence in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] stack trace and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3.
8) Step 8: Report a potential race only when both conditions hold: (a) deregistration unlocks before procfs/sysfs teardown, and (b) registration performs lookup and then procfs/sysfs creation under the same mutex — this aligns with the specific race window described in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3 and reduces unrelated patterns.
9) Step 9: Tie the object identity: ensure the same “device” data flows to list_del in deregistration and to procfs/sysfs teardown calls, and that the registration’s lookup and procfs creation operate on the same device type or naming prefix — this mitigates FPs by confirming both paths operate on the same resource (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] atm_dev_* functions).
10) Step 10: Exclude cases where teardown calls themselves take the same mutex before doing procfs/sysfs removal (if detectable intra-procedurally) — this avoids flagging code that reestablishes protection internally; approximate by checking for a lock of the same mutex within direct callees.
11) Step 11: Exclude cases where no procfs/sysfs creation is observed in any registration path under the mutex for the same subsystem/prefix — without creation under lock, the specific duplicate-entry race is less supported (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] 3).
12) Step 12: Prioritize findings where a WARN-triggering procfs function (e.g., proc_register/proc_create) is present in the registration path and a matching dereference removal (list_del) precedes early unlock in deregistration — this mirrors the “proc_dir_entry already registered” splat in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION].

3. Target Elements
- Functions named with register/create vs deregister/unregister/remove.
- Mutex lock/unlock call sites and the specific mutex variables used.
- Calls that manipulate shared registries (e.g., list_del on dev->dev_list or similar).
- Calls related to procfs/sysfs creation/removal (names containing proc_/sysfs_ with create/register vs deregister/unregister/remove semantics).
- Lookup routines (names containing “lookup”) and list iterations under lock.
- Dataflow of the device pointer through list operations and procfs/sysfs operations.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the specific mutex variable from lock to unlock to define critical sections.
- Track the device object from function parameters to list_del and to procfs/sysfs teardown calls in deregistration; similarly to lookup and procfs/sysfs creation in registration.
- Track list head/member field identity (e.g., dev->dev_list) to associate registration’s lookup with deregistration’s removal, when possible by name/field match.
- Correlate subsystem by function name prefixes and file/module locality to tie registration and deregistration paths.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A deregistration function locks a mutex, calls list_del(&dev->dev_list), unlocks, then calls atm_unregister_sysfs/dev_proc_deregister; a registration function locks the same mutex, calls __atm_dev_lookup(), then proc_create/proc_register — expect a report (matches [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Negative: The same deregistration holds the mutex across atm_unregister_sysfs and atm_proc_dev_deregister (no unlock until after teardown), and registration does lookup+create under the mutex — expect no report (matches patched intent per [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]).
- Negative: Deregistration unlocks before teardown, but registration does not create procfs/sysfs under the mutex or lacks a lookup step — expect no or low-priority report per Step 11.
- Test harness notes: Run on a small mock subsystem with clear naming (foo_dev_register/deregister) and on the ATM code pre- and post-patch to confirm differential results.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires interprocedural correlation of lock regions, resource operations, and cross-function matching by mutex and naming; constrained by heuristics but tractable.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Different mutexes protecting different aspects: mitigate by requiring the same mutex variable in both registration and deregistration.
- Teardown functions that internally acquire the same mutex: mitigate by scanning direct callees for re-locking.
- Registrations that intentionally create procfs/sysfs outside the mutex: mitigate by requiring observed creation under lock (Step 7).
- Unrelated lists/lookups with similar names: mitigate by correlating device pointer flow and matching field names (e.g., dev_list) and function name prefixes.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes Linux-style naming patterns for register/deregister, lookup, list_del, and procfs/sysfs helpers (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- May not precisely prove that registration lookup iterates the exact same list as deregistration removal; relies on field/name and prefix heuristics.
- Cannot fully model locking inside deeper callees beyond shallow analysis; may miss protection reestablished internally.
- Does not account for other synchronization mechanisms beyond the observed mutex that could serialize teardown/creation.
