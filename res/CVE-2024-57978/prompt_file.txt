1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57978

2. Vulnerability Type
Error pointer dereference (invalid pointer dereference) due to missing IS_ERR/IS_ERR_OR_NULL validation

3. Root Cause Summary
The driver’s power-domain detach routine mxc_jpeg_detach_pm_domains() called pm_runtime_suspended() on jpeg->pd_dev[i] after checking only for non-NULL. When jpeg->pd_dev[i] held an ERR_PTR (e.g., from a failed dev_pm_domain_attach_by_id()), this unguarded call dereferenced an error pointer, causing a kernel Oops. The patch adds IS_ERR_OR_NULL() checks to ensure only valid struct device pointers are passed to pm/runtime and device link APIs.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
V4L2 media driver for NXP i.MX JPEG encoder/decoder (drivers/media/platform/nxp/imx-jpeg/mxc-jpeg.c), specifically power domain attach/detach handling.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In mxc_jpeg_detach_pm_domains(), the code did:
“if (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))”
This only excluded NULL but not error pointers. jpeg->pd_dev[i] can be an ERR_PTR if dev_pm_domain_attach_by_id() failed; the detach path was invoked on that failure, leading to calling pm_runtime_suspended() with an invalid pointer.

3) Trigger Condition:
- dev_pm_domain_attach_by_id(dev, i) returns an ERR_PTR for one or more domains during mxc_jpeg_attach_pm_domains().
- The failure path executes mxc_jpeg_detach_pm_domains(jpeg) (see goto fail: mxc_jpeg_detach_pm_domains(jpeg);).
- Detach loops over jpeg->pd_dev[i] entries and invokes pm_runtime_suspended() on an ERR_PTR due to missing IS_ERR check.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Passing an ERR_PTR to pm_runtime_suspended() causes an invalid pointer dereference in the PM runtime core, leading to a kernel Oops/panic and denial of service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Strengthen pointer validation in the detach sequence by using IS_ERR_OR_NULL() before calling pm_runtime_suspended(), device_link_del(), and dev_pm_domain_detach(), ensuring these helpers are invoked only on valid pointers.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In mxc_jpeg_detach_pm_domains():
  - Replaced “if (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))” with “if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(jpeg->pd_dev[i]) && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))”.
  - Replaced “if (jpeg->pd_link[i] && !IS_ERR(jpeg->pd_link[i]))” with “if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(jpeg->pd_link[i]))”.
  - Replaced “if (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !IS_ERR(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))” with “if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))”.
These changes block calls on ERR_PTRs and NULLs, directly addressing the dereference of error pointers.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or ordering changes were made. The fix is purely defensive pointer validation in the teardown path and does not affect concurrency semantics.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Drivers that store outcome of helper APIs in pointers which may be ERR_PTRs must use IS_ERR_OR_NULL() before dereferencing or passing to subsystem APIs; failure to do so can cause reliable kernel crashes on error paths. This patch exemplifies a best practice for power domain/device link teardown routines, especially when detach functions may run after partial initialization failures. Strengthening error-path robustness reduces attack surface for local DoS via misconfiguration or induced failures in resource acquisition.
