1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-39735

2. Vulnerability Type
Integer overflow leading to slab out-of-bounds read

3. Root Cause Summary
In ea_get() at the size_check label, the code used clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)) with an upper bound derived from EALIST_SIZE() that can exceed INT_MAX. The upper bound is effectively treated as int, overflowing and causing the clamped result to become negative. This negative int was then passed to print_hex_dump() as a size_t length, expanding to a very large value and causing hex_dump_to_buffer() to read beyond the allocated slab buffer (slab-out-of-bounds read). The patch adds validation to ensure EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) does not exceed INT_MAX before using it for clamping or dumping.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
JFS filesystem, extended attributes handling (ea_get in fs/jfs/xattr.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- Missing upper-bound validation for EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) relative to INT_MAX.
- Misuse of clamp_t with type int while the upper bound originates from a wider unsigned domain, causing an overflow/truncation.
- Directly using the (possibly negative) clamped value as a length to print_hex_dump(), which expects a size_t.

3) Trigger Condition:
- On-disk extended attribute list where EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) is very large (e.g., 4110417968 > INT_MAX) and differs from ea_size, reaching the size_check path in ea_get().

4) Impact Mechanism:
- clamp_t(int, ...) overflows the upper bound, producing a negative size.
- print_hex_dump() receives the negative size as size_t, turning it into a huge value; its loop iterates far beyond the true buffer length.
- hex_dump_to_buffer() then reads ptr[j] out-of-bounds, resulting in a slab-out-of-bounds read.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add explicit validation to reject/log cases where EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) > INT_MAX, and skip the clamp and hex dump in that case. Only perform clamp and print_hex_dump() when the xattr length is safely representable as int.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Replaced unconditional clamp and dump with:
  - if (unlikely(EALIST_SIZE(...) > INT_MAX)) { printk("...size too large..."); }
  - else { int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(...)); printk("invalid..."); print_hex_dump(..., size, ...); }
- Preserves subsequent error handling (ea_release, rc = -EIO, goto clean_up), but prevents using an overflowing upper bound and passing a negative length to print_hex_dump().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. No locking or ordering changes; the fix is purely input validation and control-flow within a single-threaded path.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Filesystems must validate on-disk metadata sizes before casting or clamping to narrower integer types to avoid integer overflows and downstream OOB accesses.
- Auditing for clamp_t or length handling where upper bounds are derived from u32/size_t but cast to int is advisable across the kernel, especially around logging/hexdump paths.
- Preventing unbounded hexdumps on corrupt metadata also mitigates potential secondary issues like log flooding or reading unintended memory regions.
