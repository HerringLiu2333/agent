1. Plan Summary
Generic, patch-diff–driven detection plan for pre-patch flaws when concrete root cause details are unavailable due to missing materials; focuses on recognizing code patterns typically introduced by security fixes and flagging pre-patch sites lacking equivalent protections.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — infer the fix intent by mining added or changed guards; conceptual signals — newly introduced conditionals before dereferences, calls, or copies; FP mitigation — ensure no equivalent guard exists along all feasible paths pre-patch. (No [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[FILE_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] available, so this step is generic.)

2) Step 2: Objective — find previously unchecked return values now validated; conceptual signals — fix introduces return-code checks for functions that can fail; FP mitigation — confirm that prior code used the function result or proceeded to sensitive operations without any check.

3) Step 3: Objective — detect null-pointer deref fixes; conceptual signals — added null checks or early returns before dereferencing a pointer; FP mitigation — verify that the same pointer is dereferenced on at least one path without a dominating null check in the pre-patch code.

4) Step 4: Objective — detect bounds/length validation added before memory or string operations; conceptual signals — comparisons between input length and buffer capacity guarding memcpy/memmove/str* or index-based writes; FP mitigation — require dataflow from an external/variable size to the sink and absence of a dominating size validation pre-fix.

5) Step 5: Objective — detect integer overflow/size computation hardening; conceptual signals — added checks around arithmetic for allocation sizes or offsets, or use of safe helpers; FP mitigation — ensure arithmetic results influence allocation or memory access and that pre-patch lacks overflow predicates.

6) Step 6: Objective — detect race-condition or concurrency fixes; conceptual signals — newly added locks, atomics, or critical sections around shared state; FP mitigation — confirm writes/reads to shared mutable objects occur without any lock in pre-patch code and that execution can be concurrent.

7) Step 7: Objective — detect lifetime/ownership fixes (UAF/double free/leak); conceptual signals — added refcount ops, nulling after free, or reordered frees; FP mitigation — require paths where object is accessed after potential release or freed multiple times in pre-patch.

8) Step 8: Objective — detect added input validation/sanitization before sensitive operations; conceptual signals — new validation routines, whitelists, or normalization before invoking sensitive sinks; FP mitigation — tie source to external/tainted inputs (e.g., network, file, env) and ensure the sink was reachable without validation pre-patch.

9) Step 9: Objective — detect permission/authorization fixes; conceptual signals — added auth/ACL/capability checks guarding privileged actions; FP mitigation — verify the guarded calls are sensitive (file perms, process control, device ops) and no equivalent check existed on all entry paths.

10) Step 10: Objective — detect error-handling fixes preventing fall-through; conceptual signals — added early returns/gotos on error, or setting error codes; FP mitigation — ensure pre-patch proceeded to use uninitialized/invalid state after an error-prone call.

11) Step 11: Objective — correlate fix guards to exact use sites; conceptual signals — match the guarded variable/return to the subsequent deref/copy/privileged call; FP mitigation — exclude cases where guard exists in an always-dominating caller or wrapper function.

12) Step 12: Objective — deduplicate and prioritize; conceptual signals — group findings by function/sink and rank by sink severity and taint evidence; FP mitigation — suppress findings when equivalent checks exist via macros or inlined helpers.

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions and call sites (including return-value uses and ignored returns).
- Pointer dereferences, array indexing, and memory/string operations.
- Condition checks (null, bounds, arithmetic overflow predicates).
- Allocation sites and size computations used in allocations/copies.
- Lock/unlock and atomic operations; regions defining critical sections.
- Free/release/refcount operations and subsequent uses.
- Authorization/permission checks near privileged APIs.
- Error-handling paths (early returns, gotos, error codes).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from potentially external/variable inputs (parameters, IO, environment, IPC) to:
  - Memory operations (copy, format, index) and allocation sizes.
  - Pointer dereferences and offset computations.
  - Privileged/sensitive API invocations.
- Track object lifetimes: allocations/refcount increments to frees/decrements and subsequent uses.
- Track concurrency context: shared variables accessed across threads/interrupts without consistent synchronization.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function that memcpy’s using a parameter length into a fixed buffer without any prior length check; a fix adds a length comparison before memcpy. Expect a finding on the pre-patch memcpy site.
- Positive: Code that dereferences a pointer returned from an allocator without a null check; a fix adds if (!p) return. Expect a finding on the deref site.
- Positive: Code ignoring a function’s error return and continuing to use the result; a fix adds error checking and early return. Expect a finding on the unchecked-return path.
- Negative: Code where a caller already enforces bounds/authorization and the callee lacks a duplicate check. Expect no finding when the guard dominates all call paths.
- Negative: Code with safe wrappers around memory ops that perform internal checks. Expect no finding if the wrapper guarantees safety.
- Test harness notes: Run on a minimal project with pre/post versions to validate that the checker flags pre-patch sites and is silent post-patch; include macro-based guards and cross-function dominance cases.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires building generic patterns for common fix-introduced guards and interprocedural dominance/taint analysis but not deep domain specialization due to missing CVE specifics.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Guards located in callers or wrappers rather than local scope; mitigate with interprocedural dominance analysis.
- Macro-inlined validations not recognized; mitigate by expanding macro references and modeling common safe wrappers.
- Dead code or unreachable paths; mitigate with basic control-flow feasibility pruning.
- Benign ignored returns where APIs are documented as safe to ignore; mitigate with API allowlists or annotations.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the checker cannot target a specific vulnerability class for CVE-2024-58052.
- Plan assumes the fix introduces explicit code patterns (guards, checks, synchronization) that can be contrasted with pre-patch code.
- Sensitivity classification of sinks and taint sources may require project-specific models that are not derivable from the supplied materials.
