1. Plan Summary
Patch-differential, pattern-mining detection plan that flags code paths lacking the validation/guarding behaviors introduced by the fix for CVE-2024-58052; due to missing evidence, the plan is parameterized to derive concrete patterns once [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify the semantic deltas introduced by the patch (e.g., new guards, error handling, locking, sanitization). Signals: Newly added conditionals, early returns, error propagation, resource management, or lock/unlock around existing operations. FP mitigation: Require consistent occurrence across multiple hunks/files to avoid incidental refactors.
2) Step 2: Objective: Infer the “guard predicate(s)” added by the patch and the operations they gate. Signals: If-statements that check parameters/fields/state and conditionally skip or transform inputs before invoking an existing callee. FP mitigation: Only consider guards that directly dominate previously existing calls or dereferences per [PATCH_DIFF] structure.
3) Step 3: Objective: Build a rule that flags equivalent operations executed without the inferred guard predicate. Signals: Pre-call context lacking the same or equivalent predicate, or missing the added sanitizer/transform function. FP mitigation: Accept semantic equivalence (e.g., null-check vs macro) and exclude sites where an alternate but logically equivalent guard exists.
4) Step 4: Objective: Identify new return-value checks added at call sites by the patch. Signals: Added checks of callee return values (e.g., comparisons to error codes) or changed signatures propagating errors. FP mitigation: Limit to the same callee(s) identified in the patch and exclude call sites already checking returns in other ways.
5) Step 5: Objective: Flag call sites that invoke the patched callee without performing the newly required return-value check. Signals: Uses of the callee whose return is ignored or used unchecked in control/dataflow following the call. FP mitigation: Exclude contexts where return is provably side-effect-free or checked via wrapper utilities.
6) Step 6: Objective: Detect newly introduced input validation/sanitization helpers and mark them as sanitizers. Signals: New helper calls inserted before existing operations, transforming or validating arguments. FP mitigation: Restrict to helpers added/modified by the patch and require their output to flow into the previously existing sink.
7) Step 7: Objective: Find tainted or untrusted inputs reaching the target operations without passing through the new sanitizers/guards. Signals: Dataflow from function parameters, external interfaces, or shared state to the sink bypassing the sanitizer/guard nodes from Step 6. FP mitigation: Limit sources to those actually used in patched locations and require path-sensitivity that the guard would block.
8) Step 8: Objective: Identify concurrency/locking deltas introduced by the patch. Signals: Newly added lock acquisition/release or atomic operations around accesses/modifications of specific shared fields or structures. FP mitigation: Require a concrete read/write to the same field(s) in the critical section pre-patch.
9) Step 9: Objective: Flag accesses to the same shared state outside the new locking discipline. Signals: Reads/writes to the same variables/fields in functions not holding the added lock or without the same atomicity guarantees. FP mitigation: Exclude contexts proven single-threaded or already protected by equivalent locks.
10) Step 10: Objective: Identify lifetime/initialization fixes (e.g., added initialization, nulling on error, cleanup ordering). Signals: Patch inserts initialization before first use, adds cleanup on error paths, or prevents double-free. FP mitigation: Only target the same variables/resources and require a feasible path to use-before-init or double-free absent the patch.
11) Step 11: Objective: Encode a “must-hold” condition or “must-validate” precondition derived from patch for the affected APIs. Signals: Guard/lock/validation appears at API boundary in patch, implying a contract. FP mitigation: Restrict findings to the same API family or module inferred from file/namespace context.
12) Step 12: Objective: Rank findings by proximity to patched sites and structural similarity. Signals: Same callee names, file paths, call patterns, and AST shapes as in patched hunks. FP mitigation: Downgrade or suppress matches with low structural similarity to reduce noise.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch, plus their call sites elsewhere.
- Condition checks and early-return branches added around existing operations.
- Calls to sanitization/validation helpers introduced or moved by the patch.
- Resource allocation/cleanup sites, initialization points, and error paths.
- Lock acquisition/release boundaries and shared field accesses.
- Function return-value uses and propagation patterns.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from inputs used in patched locations (parameters, external state) to the operations that the patch now guards.
- Treat newly added validation/sanitization helpers as sanitizers; flows bypassing them are suspect.
- Model guard predicates as path blockers; report flows that reach the sink without satisfying the predicate.
- For concurrency, treat locks as path conditions; report accesses to the same fields when the “must-hold” lock is not acquired.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch-like function calling the same sink without the added guard/return-check/sanitizer/lock, allowing unvalidated input to reach the operation.
- Negative: A function performing an equivalent logical check (e.g., same condition via macro or helper), or holding an equivalent lock, before the sink; also, code where returns are checked per the patch pattern.
- Test harness notes: Derive concrete guards/sanitizers/sinks from the actual [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT] once available; construct minimal examples mirroring the added patterns and verify the checker flags only the unguarded variants.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — missing [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] means the checker must be built as a patch-driven, parameterized detector once evidence is supplied.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternate but equivalent validations or locks not syntactically identical to the patch; mitigate by semantic equivalence checks.
- Wrapper functions that encapsulate the guard or return checking; mitigate by modeling wrappers via call graph expansion.
- Generated or macro-heavy code obscuring conditions; mitigate by normalizing macro expansions and recognizing common idioms.
- Contexts where inputs are trusted by design; mitigate by constraining sources to those used in patched areas.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the vulnerability class, sinks, and precise guards are unknown.
- The plan assumes the patch introduces observable semantic deltas (guards, checks, locks) that can be mined and generalized.
- The checker’s accuracy depends on obtaining concrete patterns from the missing materials; until then, only a framework can be outlined.
