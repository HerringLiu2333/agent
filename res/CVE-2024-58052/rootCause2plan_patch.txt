1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence was provided to identify the specific vulnerability class for CVE-2024-58052; the plan outlines an evidence-driven strategy to detect pre-patch patterns that the patch introduces guards/sanitization/usage changes for once [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify all files/functions modified by the patch; Signals — names and signatures of changed functions, added/removed calls, and conditionals in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — focus only on elements directly touched by the patch.
2) Step 2: Objective — Classify the patch changes (e.g., added guard checks, validation, locking, error handling, refcount, bounds/length checks); Signals — newly added if/return/early-exit, lock/unlock pairs, reference increments/decrements, input sanitization; FP mitigation — require that the change affects control/data flow to a safety-critical operation shown in the patch.
3) Step 3: Objective — Infer the root cause category from [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] (e.g., null deref, OOB, use-after-free, auth bypass, integer overflow); Signals — explicit mention of the fault type and the specific variable/API involved; FP mitigation — only proceed with rules matching the stated fault type.
4) Step 4: Objective — Derive a vulnerable precondition pattern from the patch (the absence of the newly added check/sanitization); Signals — code regions where the added condition is missing before calling/using the same API/data; FP mitigation — require semantic equivalence of the API and relevant operands identified in the patch.
5) Step 5: Objective — Locate all call sites of modified APIs or code paths reaching changed blocks; Signals — call graph edges to modified functions and their transitive callers; FP mitigation — restrict to same module/package or file scope affected in [PATCH_DIFF] if the change is localized.
6) Step 6: Objective — Model required preconditions introduced by the patch; Signals — variables/constants referenced by added predicates (e.g., null/size/range/state/permission/lock held); FP mitigation — treat syntactically different but semantically equivalent checks as matches (e.g., macro wrappers) by resolving macros/types.
7) Step 7: Objective — Detect paths where dangerous sink uses happen without the required preconditions; Signals — control-flow paths to the same sink API/use lacking the added guard; FP mitigation — exclude paths where equivalent checks occur earlier (dominating guards) or via validated wrappers.
8) Step 8: Objective — Add dataflow as needed based on the patch (e.g., taint from external/untrusted input to sink); Signals — sources mentioned or implied by the patch (I/O, network, env, user-controlled params) flowing to the sink without the added sanitization; FP mitigation — require reachability without intervening sanitizer matching the patch’s new function/condition.
9) Step 9: Objective — Handle resource/locking/refcount changes; Signals — added acquire/release or ref increments before operations; FP mitigation — flag only when the operation occurs without the corresponding precondition and no equivalent synchronization exists on the path.
10) Step 10: Objective — Consider error handling and return-value checks added by the patch; Signals — new checks on function return codes with early returns or error propagation; FP mitigation — only flag call sites that ignore/omit the same return-value check prior to using the result.
11) Step 11: Objective — Account for version/feature guards introduced by the patch; Signals — new feature flags, capability checks, or configuration conditions; FP mitigation — ignore code compiled out by the same flags or where stronger guards already exist.
12) Step 12: Objective — Rank/report findings; Signals — matches in the exact functions/files modified by the patch ranked highest, broader patterns lower; FP mitigation — suppress duplicates at syntactic and semantic equivalence, and require full path proof of missing precondition.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified in the patch.
- Call sites to modified APIs and transitive callers.
- Condition checks introduced by the patch (null/length/range/permission/state/lock/return-value).
- Resource handling sites (allocation/free, lock/unlock, ref inc/dec).
- Dangerous sinks or operations directly affected by the patch.
- Function return-value uses where the patch added error checks.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from sources referenced by the patch (e.g., user input, I/O, network) to sinks changed by the patch.
- Treat newly introduced validators/sanitizers as barriers; pre-patch flows lacking these should be flagged.
- Model control dependencies for guards introduced by the patch (dominance of checks over sink).
- For refcount/locking, model state predicates introduced by the patch as required preconditions to the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippet mirroring the sink/API usage without the newly added guard/sanitizer/lock/refcount/return-check; expect a finding.
- Negative: Post-patch snippet with the added guard/sanitizer/lock/refcount/return-check in place; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Build minimal functions reflecting the exact patterns from [PATCH_DIFF], including macro-wrapped checks and wrapper functions to exercise equivalence handling.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — Once [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available, deriving the precondition and modeling data/control dependencies is straightforward but requires careful equivalence handling.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative equivalent checks implemented via macros or helper wrappers — mitigate by resolving macros and recognizing wrapper semantics.
- Paths infeasible due to earlier validations or configuration flags — mitigate by dominance analysis and honoring feature guards seen in the patch.
- Over-approximate taint when sources are not actually user-controlled — mitigate by restricting sources to those named in the patch/analysis.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are missing; the specific vulnerability class, APIs, and conditions are unknown.
- The plan assumes the patch introduces explicit guards/sanitizers/state handling that can be patternized; if the change is algorithmic or architectural, additional custom modeling will be required.
- Test cases and precise signals must be instantiated from the actual patch hunks and root-cause text when available.
