1. Plan Summary
Meta-strategy: infer the vulnerability pattern from patch-added guards and report similar operations reached without equivalent checks.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — locate hotspots; conceptual signals — functions/files and specific operations (calls, dereferences, arithmetic, state changes) that appear in PATCH_DIFF as modified or newly guarded.
2) Step 2: Objective — identify the fix pattern; conceptual signals — defensive constructs introduced in PATCH_DIFF such as conditionals, parameter validation, bounds/type checks, permission/capability checks, or sanitization.
3) Step 3: Objective — abstract the guard predicate; conceptual signals — variables/expressions referenced by the new checks and the exact operation(s)/API they protect, forming a guard-to-sink relationship.
4) Step 4: Objective — find similar sinks elsewhere; conceptual signals — other occurrences of the same operation/API or equivalent pattern (same function name, same side-effect, same dereference) across the codebase.
5) Step 5: Objective — detect missing preconditions; conceptual signals — code paths reaching those sinks without an equivalent guard predicate (same variables or semantically related inputs not being checked before the sink).
6) Step 6: Objective — model source-to-sink risk; conceptual signals — data/control flows from inputs referenced in PATCH_DIFF/ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS (parameters, external data) to the sink, flagging paths where the guard is absent before the sink.
7) Step 7: Objective — catch ineffective guards; conceptual signals — checks that occur after the sink, check different variables than those used by the sink, or use weaker conditions than the patch (e.g., length checked but wrong buffer used).
8) Step 8: Objective — prioritize true positives; conceptual signals — match contextual similarity to patched sites (same receiver/type, same call chain, same error handling pattern) and require reachability from an external/untrusted source if indicated.
9) Step 9: Objective — reduce noise; conceptual signals — exclude sites where alternative equivalent guards exist (e.g., centralized validation earlier in the call chain) by recognizing guard equivalence to the patch’s predicate.
10) Step 10: Objective — produce actionable reports; conceptual signals — pair each unguarded sink with the exemplar guard pattern extracted from the patch, noting the missing predicate components (variables, conditions).

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS are missing, so no concrete sink, source, or guard specifics can be defined.
- Assumes the fix adds explicit guards/validations around identifiable operations; architectural refactors or capability changes without recognizable predicates may not be detectable with this strategy.
- Assumes similar pre-patch flaws manifest as missing or inadequate checks around the same or equivalent operations; other vulnerability classes (e.g., misuse of cryptographic primitives, logic bugs unrelated to guards) may require different modeling.
