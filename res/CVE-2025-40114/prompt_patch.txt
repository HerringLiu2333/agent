1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-40114

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds read (array index bounds violation)

3. Root Cause Summary
The function veml6075_read_int_time_index returned a hardware-derived index (FIELD_GET(VEML6075_CONF_IT, conf)) without validating its range. The corresponding array veml6075_it_ms contains only 5 elements, while the hardware field can produce values in the range 0–7. This lack of bounds checking allowed veml6075_read_int_time_ms to index past the end of veml6075_it_ms, causing an out-of-bounds read.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem, VEML6075 UV light sensor driver

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
veml6075_read_int_time_index directly returned “FIELD_GET(VEML6075_CONF_IT, conf)” without range validation, and downstream code used that value to index veml6075_it_ms.

3) Trigger Condition:
The device configuration register VEML6075_CMD_CONF contains an integration time field (VEML6075_CONF_IT) that can yield values 5–7 (e.g., due to broken/misalbehaving hardware), exceeding the 0–4 valid index range for veml6075_it_ms.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Using an index ≥ ARRAY_SIZE(veml6075_it_ms) causes an out-of-bounds read from the static array, potentially returning garbage values to userspace via the IIO interface and, in worst cases, reading adjacent kernel memory.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce explicit bounds checking of the computed integration time index against ARRAY_SIZE(veml6075_it_ms) and reject invalid values by returning -EINVAL.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added a local variable int_index to hold the extracted field value.
- Inserted “if (int_index >= ARRAY_SIZE(veml6075_it_ms)) return -EINVAL;”.
- Replaced the direct return of FIELD_GET with returning the validated int_index.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes; the patch is purely input validation around regmap_read results.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Validating indices derived from device register bitfields prevents memory safety errors when hardware returns unexpected values. This hardening reduces the risk of data corruption or unintended kernel memory disclosure via IIO interfaces. It reinforces a best practice across drivers: never trust hardware-derived indices without bounds checks and use ARRAY_SIZE to guard array accesses.
