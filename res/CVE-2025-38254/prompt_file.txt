1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38254

2. Vulnerability Type
- Out-of-bounds write (memory corruption) due to unchecked length
- NULL pointer dereference

3. Root Cause Summary
In dm_helpers_read_local_edid(), the code assumed drm_edid_raw() always returns a valid EDID pointer and a sane extensions count. Pre-patch, it dereferenced the returned pointer and copied EDID bytes into a fixed-size buffer without validating the pointer or the total length, e.g., "edid = drm_edid_raw(drm_edid);" followed by "sink->dc_edid.length = EDID_LENGTH * (edid->extensions + 1);" and memmove(). If drm_edid_raw() returned NULL, a NULL dereference occurred; if it returned an EDID with a large extensions field, memmove() overflowed sink->dc_edid.raw_edid, corrupting memory.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- DRM AMDGPU display driver (amdgpu_dm), EDID read path

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- In enum dc_edid_status dm_helpers_read_local_edid(...), the code lacked:
  - a NULL check on the pointer returned by drm_edid_raw()
  - a bounds check ensuring EDID_LENGTH * (extensions + 1) fits into sink->dc_edid.raw_edid
- It directly used edid->extensions to compute the copy length and performed memmove() into a fixed-size raw_edid array.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Connecting a display or adapter that causes drm_edid_raw() to:
  - return NULL (e.g., bad/malformed EDID source), or
  - return an EDID where edid->extensions implies a total size exceeding the fixed raw_edid buffer.
- The function is invoked during EDID acquisition via DDC/AUX in dm_helpers_read_local_edid().

4) Impact Mechanism:
- NULL dereference when accessing edid->extensions on a NULL edid pointer, leading to an Oops.
- Out-of-bounds write when memmove() copies EDID_LENGTH * (extensions + 1) bytes beyond sink->dc_edid.raw_edid, causing kernel memory corruption and potential crash.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Defensive input validation added immediately after drm_edid_raw() to guard against NULL pointers and oversized EDID payloads derived from the extensions count.
- On invalid input, abort the operation by returning EDID_BAD_INPUT before computing length or copying.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In dm_helpers_read_local_edid():
  - Added:
    - if (!edid || edid->extensions >= sizeof(sink->dc_edid.raw_edid) / EDID_LENGTH) return EDID_BAD_INPUT;
  - This prevents:
    - dereferencing a NULL edid
    - computing a length that exceeds raw_edid capacity
    - performing an overflowing memmove()

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The change is purely input validation within the same execution context; no locks or ordering semantics were added or modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- EDID data originates from external hardware and must be treated as untrusted; robust validation is essential to prevent kernel memory corruption from malformed devices/adapters.
- Similar EDID handling paths should be audited for pointer validity and capacity checks, especially when interfacing with helper APIs like drm_edid_raw() that do not guarantee safe sizes.
- The fix aligns with hardening practices by bounding copies and checking for NULL, reducing attack surface in the graphics stack; further deprecation of drm_edid_raw() (as hinted by the FIXME) may improve safety.
