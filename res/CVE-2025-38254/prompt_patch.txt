1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38254

2. Vulnerability Type
- Null pointer dereference
- Out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) due to missing bounds validation

3. Root Cause Summary
The function dm_helpers_read_local_edid() trusted the output of drm_edid_raw() without validation. It dereferenced a potentially NULL edid pointer and used edid->extensions to compute a copy length into a fixed-size sink->dc_edid.raw_edid array without checking capacity. This allowed a bad or malformed EDID (or a NULL return) to cause either a kernel Oops or memory corruption via memmove with an oversized length. The patch adds explicit checks for NULL and for edid->extensions exceeding the destination buffer’s capacity, returning EDID_BAD_INPUT early.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
DRM AMD display driver (amdgpu_dm), EDID handling logic

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- No NULL check on the pointer returned by drm_edid_raw().
- No bounds check on edid->extensions before computing sink->dc_edid.length and performing memmove into sink->dc_edid.raw_edid.

3) Trigger Condition:
- drm_edid_raw() returns NULL.
- drm_edid_raw() returns EDID data where edid->extensions is large enough that EDID_LENGTH * (extensions + 1) exceeds sizeof(sink->dc_edid.raw_edid), e.g., due to a bad/malicious adapter providing malformed EDID.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- NULL dereference when accessing edid->extensions leads to kernel Oops.
- Out-of-bounds memory write when executing:
  - “sink->dc_edid.length = EDID_LENGTH * (edid->extensions + 1);”
  - “memmove(sink->dc_edid.raw_edid, (uint8_t *)edid, sink->dc_edid.length);”
  This can corrupt adjacent kernel memory and cause crashes or undefined behavior.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Input validation was added prior to using the edid pointer and computing/copying the EDID length. The function now returns EDID_BAD_INPUT when drm_edid_raw() yields NULL or when the computed number of EDID blocks would overflow the fixed destination buffer.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Inserted:
  - “if (!edid || edid->extensions >= sizeof(sink->dc_edid.raw_edid) / EDID_LENGTH) return EDID_BAD_INPUT;”
This prevents dereferencing NULL and ensures the number of 128-byte EDID blocks does not exceed the capacity of sink->dc_edid.raw_edid, thereby guarding the subsequent length calculation and memmove.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes. The patch strictly adds input checks and an early return; synchronization behavior is unaffected.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Validating EDID data mitigates externally triggered kernel instability from malformed monitors/adapters, reducing attack surface for denial-of-service via device-driven inputs. Preventing out-of-bounds writes in low-level display paths avoids potential memory corruption that could be exploited for more severe outcomes. This change exemplifies necessary hardening for parsing untrusted hardware-provided data, and similar validation should be consistently applied across EDID and other device descriptor handling paths.
