1. Plan Summary
Detect ASoC machine driver DAI-link definitions that declare the codec component as COMP_EMPTY() for back-end links, which can leave dai_name NULL and lead to strcmp-based NULL dereference during probe when no codec is bound.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify function-like macro invocations of SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS; the first argument is the DAI link identifier (e.g., names ending with “_BE” indicate back-end links).
2) Step 2: Within each SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS, conceptually separate its three component arrays: CPU component (DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_CPU(...))), codec component, and platform component.
3) Step 3: Flag links whose codec component array contains COMP_EMPTY() (e.g., DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_EMPTY())) rather than a real codec (COMP_CODEC(...)) or a dummy codec (COMP_DUMMY()).
4) Step 4: Restrict findings to back-end links by matching the link identifier suffix “_BE” (e.g., ETDM2_IN_BE, ETDM1_OUT_BE), as these are the links implicated in the crash.
5) Step 5: Elevate severity if the flagged link identifier is referenced elsewhere in the same file in an initializer array for stream connections (e.g., g_sof_conn_streams contains the link name string), indicating the link participates in active routing/probing.
6) Step 6: Add contextual evidence by checking in the same file whether other BE links use COMP_DUMMY() for their codec component; if most comparable links use COMP_DUMMY() and the flagged one uses COMP_EMPTY(), highlight it as an outlier pattern.
7) Step 7: Record whether the codec component array is entirely empty except for COMP_EMPTY() (i.e., no COMP_CODEC entries present), strengthening the inference that dai_name may be NULL under missing DT codec assignment.
8) Step 8: For each flagged link, attach a rationale that the ASoC framework and the driver perform name string comparisons during probe (root cause shows strcmp on dai_name), so COMP_EMPTY() risks NULL pointer dereference when DT omits a codec.
9) Step 9: Recommend remediation in the report by noting the fix pattern: replace COMP_EMPTY() with COMP_DUMMY() for affected BE links to ensure a non-NULL dai_name, as shown in the patch diff and description.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- The checker infers risk from macro usage; it does not evaluate runtime DT bindings, so it assumes codecs may be omitted by DT for flagged links.
- It does not analyze framework-internal strcmp call sites; it relies on root cause evidence that probe does string comparisons on dai_name.
- Macro parsing/recognition must be available; if macros are heavily redefined or generated, the checker may miss cases.
- The heuristic prioritizes back-end links (suffix “_BE”); if similar issues exist for front-end links, they may not be reported by this plan.
