1. Plan Summary
Detect ASoC machine drivers that define DAI links with an empty codec component (leaving codec dai_name NULL) and later dereference or compare that name without a NULL guard, leading to a NULL pointer dereference as in CVE-2025-38299.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — find ASoC DAI link definitions that use an empty codec component. Signals — invocations of SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS/DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY where the codec component is set via COMP_EMPTY() (based on PATCH_DIFF and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation — exclude links that use COMP_DUMMY() for the codec (which the patch adopts).

2) Step 2: Objective — model risk: codec dai_name may be NULL for links defined with COMP_EMPTY(). Signals — associate each such link with a “may-be-NULL codec dai_name” property because COMP_EMPTY() leaves dai_name unset (per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation — only mark codec components that are explicitly the codec endpoint (not CPU or platform components).

3) Step 3: Objective — identify sinks: string comparison calls that require non-NULL pointers. Signals — calls to strcmp/strncmp and kernel equivalents (__pi_strcmp in call traces) where an argument can be the link’s codec dai_name or a value derived from it (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS shows unconditional strcmp). FP mitigation — restrict to call sites within ASoC probe or link-processing code paths (e.g., functions that iterate DAI links or are named *probe), and where an argument’s dataflow can be traced from a DAI link’s codec name.

4) Step 4: Objective — trace dataflow from the “may-be-NULL codec dai_name” source to the string-comparison sink. Signals — conceptual flow through local variables, parameters, or struct fields representing DAI link/codec info to string compare calls. FP mitigation — require absence of an explicit NULL check on the pointer along the path (e.g., no preceding pointer != NULL condition that dominates the sink).

5) Step 5: Objective — detect other unsafe dereferences of codec dai_name. Signals — dereferencing fields/methods on the codec dai_name pointer (or passing it to functions that assume non-NULL) in probe code handling DAI links. FP mitigation — same dominance-based NULL-guard check and only for flows originating from links flagged in Step 2.

6) Step 6: Objective — correlate source and sink within the same driver/card definition. Signals — ensure the sink site processes the same named link(s) or same struct instance created/defined by the SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS where COMP_EMPTY() was used. FP mitigation — require either identical symbol/field references or consistent link identifiers to avoid cross-driver mixing.

7) Step 7: Objective — elevate findings when the driver’s behavior matches the pre-patch pattern. Signals — matches where the CPU side is specified (COMP_CPU(...)) and codec side is COMP_EMPTY(), mirroring PATCH_DIFF for ETDM2_IN_BE and ETDM1_OUT_BE. FP mitigation — exclude links that have no subsequent reference to codec dai_name anywhere in the driver.

8) Step 8: Objective — de-duplicate and prioritize results. Signals — group multiple sinks per source link definition and report once per risky link definition with pointers to representative sinks. FP mitigation — suppress reports if an alternative safe initialization (e.g., later assignment to a non-NULL placeholder) is detected before use.

3. Target Elements
- Macro-defined DAI link elements: SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS, DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY, COMP_EMPTY, COMP_DUMMY, COMP_CPU.
- Struct fields representing codec dai_name or equivalent identifiers within DAI links.
- Probe/initialization functions that iterate or process DAI links (e.g., *probe), as indicated by ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
- Call sites to string comparison or other APIs that require non-NULL pointers (e.g., strcmp/strncmp/__pi_strcmp).
- Conditional checks guarding pointer use (NULL checks) and their dominance over sinks.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Treat codec dai_name originating from links whose codec component is COMP_EMPTY() as a “may-be-NULL” source.
- Track flow through assignments, struct field reads, function arguments, and local variables to sink calls that assume non-NULL input.
- Enforce path feasibility by requiring no dominating NULL check on the pointer and no reassignment to a guaranteed non-NULL value prior to the sink.
- Correlate flows only within the same driver/module to prevent cross-component false joins.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A driver defines SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEFS with CPU via COMP_CPU(...) and codec via COMP_EMPTY(); its probe reads the link’s codec dai_name and calls strcmp against a literal without a prior NULL check — expect a finding.
- Negative: Same as above but codec uses COMP_DUMMY() (as in PATCH_DIFF) — expect no finding.
- Negative: Driver uses COMP_EMPTY() but never reads or compares codec dai_name — expect no finding.
- Negative: Driver uses COMP_EMPTY() and does compare the name but has an explicit NULL check guarding the strcmp — expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Include cross-file scenarios where link definitions are in one file and probe logic in another; validate dataflow and dominance handling.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: macro-aware pattern identification plus intra-project dataflow and dominance analysis; high security relevance due to boot-time crash (per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Macro expansion ambiguity: mitigate by matching conceptual roles (codec vs CPU) and requiring clear association to codec dai_name.
- Alternative initialization paths that guarantee non-NULL: mitigate by tracking reassignments and excluding if non-NULL assignment dominates the sink.
- Sinks that accept NULL safely (unlikely for strcmp): mitigate by focusing on known non-NULL-requiring APIs (supported by call trace in PATCH_DESCRIPTION).
- Links for which DT always provides a codec: static analysis can’t confirm DT; mitigate by requiring actual use of the potentially NULL name without guards.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes COMP_EMPTY() leaves codec dai_name NULL, based on ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS; exact struct/field names may vary across drivers.
- Cannot verify runtime DT bindings; the checker infers risk from COMP_EMPTY() usage and unguarded uses.
- Macro role identification (which component is “codec”) relies on conventional macro argument positions; deviations may reduce accuracy.
- The exact function names in sinks may vary; we assume common string compare APIs as indicated by the call trace (__pi_strcmp) in PATCH_DESCRIPTION.
