1. Plan Summary
Derive and detect the pre-patch missing-guard/misuse pattern by diff-mining the patch’s added checks and applying equivalent-guard-absent analysis to analogous sinks and flows.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Infer the vulnerability guard pattern from the fix. Conceptual signals: Identify what the patch adds around a specific operation (e.g., new conditional checks, early returns, state transitions) and which variables/objects they protect. FP mitigation: Only proceed if the guard directly controls a distinct sink (statement/expression) altered by the patch; ignore cosmetic changes.
2) Step 2: Objective: Isolate the protected sink(s). Conceptual signals: The statement(s)/call(s)/dereference(s) that are now dominated by the newly added guard, or whose arguments are revalidated in the patch. FP mitigation: Require clear dominance/postdomination relation between the guard and the sink in the patched code to confirm the pairing.
3) Step 3: Objective: Characterize the guard semantics. Conceptual signals: Classify the guard as a null-check, bounds/length check, permission/capability check, state/lock precondition, return-value check, or error handling path introduced by the patch. FP mitigation: Treat macros and helper wrappers as equivalent if they reduce to the same semantic predicate.
4) Step 4: Objective: Identify the data elements guarded. Conceptual signals: Determine which variables/fields/pointers/lengths/flags appear in the guard and flow into the sink (parameters, struct fields, return values). FP mitigation: Exclude guards that do not influence the sink operands or side effects.
5) Step 5: Objective: Define “missing-equivalent-guard” criteria. Conceptual signals: For each guarded sink form, define what constitutes an equivalent guard (same variable, same predicate family, comparable threshold). FP mitigation: Accept equivalent guards in caller/callee or earlier control-flow as sufficient; avoid duplicate reporting when alternative guards exist.
6) Step 6: Objective: Search pre-patch patterns across the codebase. Conceptual signals: Find identical or structurally similar sinks where the guarded variables reach the sink without an equivalent guard dominating the use site. FP mitigation: Require path feasibility and visibility (no intervening guard or sanitization) and filter unreachable/report-spam duplicates.
7) Step 7: Objective: Track relevant dataflow to the sink. Conceptual signals: Trace flow from parameters/returns/global reads into sink operands/arguments that the patch’s guard covers; include aliases and field accesses. FP mitigation: Limit to flows that remain unvalidated on the path (no intervening checks that imply the same constraint).
8) Step 8: Objective: Model state/locking preconditions if patch adds them. Conceptual signals: Recognize acquisition/release APIs or state flags the patch requires before the sink; detect sink executions lacking those preconditions. FP mitigation: Consider alternative synchronization patterns or higher-level invariants that guarantee the state.
9) Step 9: Objective: Model error handling/early-return introduced by patch. Conceptual signals: New early returns on bad input/failed checks; pre-patch paths that continue into the sink without those early exits. FP mitigation: Don’t flag when equivalent early-return or error propagation already exists upstream.
10) Step 10: Objective: Interprocedural usage consistency. Conceptual signals: If the patch moved a guard inside a callee, detect other call sites or similar callees where the same sink occurs without the internal guard or without documented caller-side validation. FP mitigation: Respect documented API contracts when available and skip when the callee now enforces the invariant.
11) Step 11: Objective: Reduce noise from dead code or constant conditions. Conceptual signals: Exclude sinks under conditions that are provably safe (constant true guards or impossible paths). FP mitigation: Apply simple constant/enum reasoning to avoid false alerts.
12) Step 12: Objective: Prioritize likely exploitable instances. Conceptual signals: Prefer external/input-derived flows, memory/IO-sensitive sinks, or privilege-impacting paths that match the patch’s guarded context. FP mitigation: Deprioritize purely local, non-user-influenced paths.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods containing added conditional checks and early returns (from the patch).
- The sink operations directly controlled by those checks (dereferences, copies, arithmetic, syscalls, privileged operations).
- Condition checks, error paths, and guard predicates introduced by the patch.
- Allocation/initialization sites and return-value uses relevant to the guard.
- Lock/state acquisition and release boundaries if the patch adds them.
- Call sites to functions whose internal guarding changed in the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from function parameters, return values from callees, and global/field reads into the protected sink operands.
- Treat the guarded variables as “must be validated” and detect paths reaching the sink without passing through an equivalent validator.
- Propagate through aliases and field/element selections; respect sanitizers that implement the same predicate as the patch’s guard.
- If the guard is a state/lock precondition, model path conditions that establish the required state before the sink.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function calling a sink (e.g., pointer dereference or copy) without any precondition; a patch adds a specific check and early return guarding that sink. Expect a detection on the pre-patch form.
- Negative: Same sink guarded by an equivalent check earlier in the control flow or via a validated helper; or a callee that now internally checks, with call sites not needing duplicate checks. Expect no detection.
- Test harness notes: Include aliasing cases, macro-wrapped checks, interprocedural validation, and both state/lock and value checks to verify guard-equivalence logic and path feasibility.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — The concrete pattern depends on the missing patch details and requires robust guard-equivalence, dominance, and interprocedural dataflow modeling.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative guard forms (macros, helper functions, different but equivalent predicates) — mitigate via semantic-equivalence heuristics.
- Path-insensitive over-approximation (missing dominance/path feasibility) — mitigate via basic path feasibility and dominance/postdomination checks.
- Implicit invariants (initialization guarantees, protocol states, locks held by callers) — mitigate by modeling common API/state protocols and recognizing known acquisition patterns.
- Dead or unreachable code — mitigate with simple constant propagation and reachability checks.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The critical inputs [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are missing; the concrete root cause and guard pattern cannot be determined from the supplied materials.
- The plan is a procedural template to be instantiated once the patch reveals the specific guard, sink, and state/validation semantics.
- Assumes the patch introduces explicit guard(s) or state-management changes that can be mined and generalized to pre-patch misuse patterns.
