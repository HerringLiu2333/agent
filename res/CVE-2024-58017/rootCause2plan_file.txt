1. Plan Summary
Patch-driven checker template that infers the safety guard(s) introduced by the fix and flags equivalent sink operations executed without those guard(s) in pre-patch code.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify fix-introduced “protective” constructs. Conceptual signals — Additions in the patch that introduce new condition checks, early returns, error handling, or resource/lock handling around an operation. FP mitigation — Focus only on constructs newly added by the patch and exclude purely cosmetic/logging changes. (Note: [PATCH_DIFF] not provided; this step requires it.)

2) Step 2: Objective — Map the protected sink(s). Conceptual signals — Operations now placed under the new guard (e.g., a call, dereference, resource use) or immediately preceded by newly added failure paths. FP mitigation — Exclude cases where the added code doesn’t affect execution safety (e.g., added logging without changed control flow).

3) Step 3: Objective — Extract the guard predicate shape. Conceptual signals — Expressions/variables used in the new condition (e.g., comparisons, state/flag checks, API-return-value checks) and the associated error paths. FP mitigation — Treat as a guard only if the predicate controls reachability of the sink (i.e., sink is in then-branch or after a return on failure).

4) Step 4: Objective — Identify variables and values the guard depends on. Conceptual signals — Data elements referenced in the guard (parameters, fields, function return values) and whether they flow to the sink. FP mitigation — Require a concrete usage connection between the guarded variable(s) and the sink operation.

5) Step 5: Objective — Build a semantic pattern for the guard-to-sink relationship. Conceptual signals — A rule that the sink is safe only if the guard predicate holds or its error path executes; equivalently, the sink should be dominated by the guard. FP mitigation — Normalize simple boolean inversions and short-circuit patterns to avoid missing equivalent guard forms.

6) Step 6: Objective — Find unguarded equivalents of the sink elsewhere. Conceptual signals — Same or semantically equivalent sink operations (same callee, same operation on same data) executed without an equivalent guard predicate in the dominance region. FP mitigation — Restrict search to same module/component or closely related functions to reduce unrelated matches.

7) Step 7: Objective — Account for guard equivalence across refactorings. Conceptual signals — Equivalent checks implemented via helper functions or different syntactic forms that ensure the same precondition. FP mitigation — Consider only helpers introduced/used by the patch as canonical guards; ignore unrelated utilities.

8) Step 8: Objective — Detect missing error-handling paths coupled with the guard. Conceptual signals — In the patch, error returns/cleanup are added on guard failure; flag locations where the sink can proceed without any such handling. FP mitigation — Exclude paths where upstream callers already enforce the guard or handle the error (inter-procedural check with call-context awareness).

9) Step 9: Objective — Handle multiple conjunctive guards. Conceptual signals — Patch adds multiple checks (e.g., several conditions) before the sink; require that all must hold or fail-fast. FP mitigation — Do not flag if an equivalent set of checks is present, even if reordered or split into early returns.

10) Step 10: Objective — Reduce noise from dead code and non-functional diffs. Conceptual signals — Exclude unreachable code, disabled blocks, test scaffolding, or code under feature flags not present in production. FP mitigation — Limit to production code paths reachable from exported/entry functions.

3. Target Elements
- Condition checks controlling execution (if/else, early returns, error handling).
- Function calls and dereferences serving as sinks protected by the patch.
- Variables/expressions used in new guards (parameters, fields, API return values).
- Lock acquisitions/releases or resource state transitions added by the patch.
- Call sites of newly guarded functions, to detect missing handling of return/status.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from variables/values used in the new guard predicate to the sink operation to confirm relevance.
- Track API return values that the patch begins to check; ensure downstream uses of those values are guarded.
- Track inter-procedural propagation of guard preconditions from callee to caller when the patch moves checks across function boundaries.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function performing a sink operation without any of the guard predicates introduced by the fix; the checker should report it as missing the required precondition.
- Negative: The same sink operation preceded by an equivalent guard (even if implemented via a helper or reordered), and code that adds only logging without control-flow changes; the checker should not report.
- Test harness notes: Create minimal examples where the guard controls reachability to the sink and variants where the guard is syntactically different but semantically equivalent.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — Requires patch-aware pattern extraction and guard equivalence matching but uses well-scoped, fix-derived patterns.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Syntactic differences that still enforce the same precondition; mitigate by normalizing boolean logic and recognizing helper-guard functions.
- Contexts where the guard is enforced by upstream callers; mitigate with inter-procedural dominance checks and caller-context analysis.
- Non-functional diffs (logging, comments) misidentified as guards; mitigate by requiring control-flow impact and sink reachability constraints.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the specific guard predicates, sinks, and APIs are unknown; the plan is a patch-driven template requiring those artifacts to instantiate concrete patterns.
- Assumes the fix introduces explicit guard(s) or error handling around identifiable sink(s); if the fix is a deep refactor without localized guards, this approach may not apply.
- Assumes access to both pre- and post-fix code to learn guard semantics; otherwise, manual specification of the guard will be needed.
