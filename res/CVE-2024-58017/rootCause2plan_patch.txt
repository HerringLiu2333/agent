1. Plan Summary
Generic detection plan to identify missing validations or unsafe usages that the patch introduced or corrected, acknowledging that no [PATCH_DIFF] or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] content is available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Infer the vulnerable pattern by analyzing what was added/changed in [PATCH_DIFF]; Signals — functions, parameters, and operations that gained checks, guards, or error handling; FP mitigation — scope to files/functions touched by the patch and adjacent statements. 
2) Step 2: Objective — Derive required guard predicates; Signals — new conditional checks (e.g., null/bounds/state/permission checks) immediately dominating sensitive operations; FP mitigation — require that the same variables/expressions used in the sink are referenced by the guard and that control-flow dominance holds.
3) Step 3: Objective — Identify protected sinks; Signals — operations moved under new conditions or replaced with safer APIs; FP mitigation — only consider sinks that are syntactically near the added guard or explicitly modified in the patch.
4) Step 4: Objective — Report unguarded sink uses; Signals — occurrences of the sink pattern without the corresponding guard predicate present in dominating control flow; FP mitigation — accept semantically equivalent guards (e.g., logically equivalent conditions or common validation helper calls).
5) Step 5: Objective — Enforce return-value/error handling requirements; Signals — calls that gained return-value checks or error paths in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — suppress if the return value is branching to an error/cleanup path or passed into a validation helper.
6) Step 6: Objective — Validate resource/lock sequencing; Signals — additions of lock acquisition, reference counting, or initialization before use; FP mitigation — restrict to the same resource variable and same function or clearly connected call chains changed by the patch.
7) Step 7: Objective — Track state preconditions; Signals — added state/flag checks or transitions prior to use of a component; FP mitigation — require that the state variable guards the exact subsequent use sites identified in the patch.
8) Step 8: Objective — Model sanitization; Signals — new sanitization/normalization calls placed before a data use; FP mitigation — only treat as required sanitizers those introduced in [PATCH_DIFF] and ensure they post-dominate data sources and dominate the sink.
9) Step 9: Objective — Capture parameter constraints; Signals — new parameter validation at function entry (range, nullability, size); FP mitigation — propagate the requirement only to callers passing through unchanged arguments or clearly mapped parameters.
10) Step 10: Objective — Interprocedural propagation of contracts; Signals — when patch asserts a callee contract at caller sites; FP mitigation — bound propagation depth and require that the same sink/guard pairing is preserved across call edges.
11) Step 11: Objective — Equivalence detection for alternative APIs; Signals — replacement of unsafe API with safer variant in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — flag legacy-API uses unless preceded by equivalent validations or wrapped by a known safe abstraction.
12) Step 12: Objective — Version/file scoping; Signals — limit to modules/namespaces/files touched by [PATCH_DIFF] and to constructs mentioned in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; FP mitigation — exclude unrelated modules to reduce noise.

3. Target Elements
- Function definitions and entries where parameter checks may be added.
- Call sites where return values must be checked or where APIs were replaced.
- Conditional statements guarding memory, resource, or state-dependent operations.
- Allocation/deallocation and lock/unlock sites, and initialization before use.
- Data sanitization/validation helper call sites and their dominance relationships.
- Sinks: operations directly modified or newly guarded by the patch (I/O, memory, parsing, permission-sensitive actions).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from inputs/parameters to identified sinks that, per [PATCH_DIFF], now require sanitization/validation.
- Treat newly added validation/sanitization/guard functions as sanitizers; require them to dominate the sink.
- If return-value checks are added, treat unchecked flows of the result into further computation as violations.
- For state/lock/initialization, model control/data dependencies ensuring the required action occurs before sink use.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch-like snippet invoking the identified sink without the newly added guard/sanitizer/lock or ignoring a return value that the patch began checking; expect a finding.
- Negative: The same snippet with the guard/sanitizer/lock added as in [PATCH_DIFF], or with a semantically equivalent validation helper; expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Build minimal functions mirroring the patch-introduced patterns (guards around sinks, return-value checks, resource sequencing) and run intra- and interprocedural cases.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium (requires extracting exact guard/sink patterns from [PATCH_DIFF] and modeling them; no domain specifics provided here).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent validations expressed differently; mitigate via dominance and variable/argument correspondence checks and allowlists of known validation helpers.
- Alternative safe APIs or wrappers not present in the patch; mitigate by recognizing wrappers that encapsulate the required checks.
- Paths proven safe by invariants not visible to static analysis; mitigate by requiring close proximity between guard and sink and limiting scope to patched regions.
- Macro/inline checks expanding differently; mitigate by normalizing common macro guards if identified in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DIFF] or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] content is available; thus no concrete functions, guards, or APIs can be named or modeled here.
- Language, framework, and module context are unknown; assumptions about guards/sinks (null, bounds, state, locks, sanitization) are generic.
- Assumes the patch adds explicit checks, safer APIs, or ordering constraints that can be mined and converted into precondition rules.
- Interprocedural depth and semantic equivalence checks may be limited by available CodeQL libraries for the specific language.
