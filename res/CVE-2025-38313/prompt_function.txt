1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38313

2. Vulnerability Type
Double free / invalid free (free of non-kmalloc pointer alias leading to memory corruption)

3. Root Cause Summary
The error cleanup path unconditionally freed both mc_bus and mc_dev without respecting their allocation/ownership relationship. In the DPRC path, mc_dev is not separately allocated; it aliases the mc_bus->mc_dev field (“mc_dev = &mc_bus->mc_dev”). Pre-patch code did “kfree(mc_bus); kfree(mc_dev);” which frees the kmalloc’d mc_bus and then attempts to free an interior pointer (&mc_bus->mc_dev), effectively a double-free/invalid free of the same allocation. The patch corrects this by freeing only mc_bus when it was allocated, and freeing mc_dev only when it was separately allocated (non-DPRC path).

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
bus: fsl-mc (Freescale Management Complex bus/device handling)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
Unconditional deallocation in error_cleanup_dev: “kfree(mc_bus); kfree(mc_dev);” despite mc_dev being an embedded field within mc_bus for DPRC devices (“mc_dev = &mc_bus->mc_dev”), causing a free of a non-kmalloc interior pointer after freeing its owning allocation.

3) Trigger Condition:
Any error path taken after allocating mc_bus in the DPRC case (obj_desc->type == "dprc"), such as unknown device type, get_dprc_icid() failure, MMIO region retrieval failure, or device_add() failure, leading execution to error_cleanup_dev.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The second kfree() on mc_dev (an alias to &mc_bus->mc_dev) after kfree(mc_bus) results in double-free/invalid free, corrupting slab metadata and potentially causing kernel crashes, memory corruption, or exploitable conditions.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce conditional deallocation based on whether mc_bus was allocated. If mc_bus exists, free only mc_bus; otherwise free mc_dev. This aligns deallocation with the allocation path and ownership model.

2) Key Code Changes:
In error_cleanup_dev:
- Replace:
  kfree(mc_bus);
  kfree(mc_dev);
- With:
  if (mc_bus)
      kfree(mc_bus);
  else
      kfree(mc_dev);
Unchanged: kfree(mc_dev->regions) remains safe (kfree(NULL) allowed).

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes; the fix is purely in memory management on the error path. Mutex initialization (mc_bus->scan_mutex) remains unaffected; no race/ordering adjustments were made.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Error paths must strictly mirror allocation ownership, especially when using embedded struct patterns (pointer aliasing to fields within kmalloc’d objects). Unconditional frees can lead to double-free or invalid free vulnerabilities, which are high-impact in kernel space. This emphasizes careful design of cleanup code to distinguish between separately allocated objects versus embedded members and the importance of defensive checks even if checkpatch warns about kfree(NULL).
