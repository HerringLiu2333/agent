1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58081

2. Vulnerability Type
Improper initialization/ordering leading to NULL pointer dereference (kernel crash/DoS)

3. Root Cause Summary
The driver called pm_genpd_init() before setting genpd.name in mmp_pm_domain_register(). pm_genpd_init() uses genpd->name to set the embedded struct deviceâ€™s name via dev_set_name(). With genpd.name still NULL at that time, the device name remained NULL. Later, core PM-domain debug code (changed by commit 899f44531fe6 to use dev_name(&genpd->dev)) dereferenced this NULL name, causing a NULL pointer dereference in strlen() while creating debugfs/devfs entries.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock driver for Marvell MMP power islands (drivers/clk/mmp), integrating with the generic PM domain (pmdomain core) and its debugfs/devfs infrastructure.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In mmp_pm_domain_register(), pm_genpd_init(&pm_domain->genpd, NULL, true) was invoked before pm_domain->genpd.name = name; and before assigning power callbacks. This ordering left genpd->dev without a valid name because pm_genpd_init() performs dev_set_name() based on genpd->name.

3) Trigger Condition:
During PM domain initialization and subsequent debugfs/devfs setup (genpd_debug_init/genpd_debug_add), dev_name(&genpd->dev) was accessed for directory creation. Since the device name was never set (NULL), the debugfs path creation called strlen on a NULL pointer, reproducing the crash described in the patch notes.

4) Impact Mechanism:
A NULL pointer dereference in kernel space (strlen on dev_name == NULL) leads to a kernel oops/panic, causing denial-of-service, typically during boot/initcall when PM domains are initialized.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Reorder initialization: set genpd.name and callbacks prior to invoking pm_genpd_init(), ensuring pm_genpd_init() has a valid name to pass to dev_set_name() and thereby avoiding NULL dev_name.

2) Key Code Changes:
- The call to pm_genpd_init(&pm_domain->genpd, NULL, true) was moved after:
  - pm_domain->genpd.name = name;
  - pm_domain->genpd.power_on = mmp_pm_domain_power_on;
  - pm_domain->genpd.power_off = mmp_pm_domain_power_off.
This guarantees that pm_genpd_init() runs with genpd.name populated.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency changes; the fix is purely an initialization-order correction. Spinlock assignment (pm_domain->lock = lock) remains unchanged and is unrelated to the fault.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Initialization-order bugs in subsystem integration can lead to system-wide instability and denial-of-service, especially in early boot paths. This case highlights the need to set identifying fields (like genpd.name) before core initialization routines that consume them (pm_genpd_init). Similar drivers using generic PM domains must ensure proper sequencing when flags or core behavior (e.g., GENPD_FLAG_DEV_NAME_FW switching to dev_name usage) change, to prevent latent NULL dereferences in debugfs/devfs creation or other infrastructure relying on device naming.
