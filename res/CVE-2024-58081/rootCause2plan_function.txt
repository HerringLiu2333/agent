1. Plan Summary
Detect calls to pm_genpd_init made before the associated generic_pm_domain’s name field is set, which leaves the device name NULL and can trigger a NULL dereference later, as evidenced by the reordering fix.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify candidate initialization sites. Signals — Locate call sites of pm_genpd_init with an argument that is a generic_pm_domain object or the address of a field of that type (e.g., &X->genpd). FP mitigation — Restrict to calls within functions that also set fields of the same generic_pm_domain (e.g., power_on/power_off) to focus on PM-domain setup, based on the pre-/post-patch ordering in [PATCH_DIFF] and [FUNCTION_CONTENT].

2) Step 2: Objective — Resolve the specific genpd object being initialized. Signals — From the pm_genpd_init argument, recover the base object (e.g., the outer struct instance whose genpd field is passed, like pm_domain->genpd) and track intra-procedural aliases (e.g., via local pointer variables). FP mitigation — Prefer precise field-sensitive aliasing for address-of field patterns; if aliasing cannot be resolved, do not report.

3) Step 3: Objective — Find writes to the name field for this exact genpd object. Signals — Search the enclosing function for assignments to <that genpd>.name or equivalent via aliases (e.g., gpd->name = ...), as the patch sets genpd.name explicitly (see [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — Ensure the assignment targets the same resolved object instance; ignore writes to unrelated variables or different struct instances.

4) Step 4: Objective — Determine ordering relative to pm_genpd_init. Signals — Establish whether a write to <genpd>.name dominates the pm_genpd_init call along all paths; if not, record that pm_genpd_init may execute with name unset. FP mitigation — Use control-flow dominance within the function to require that the name write is guaranteed before the call on all feasible paths to avoid path-insensitive false alarms.

5) Step 5: Objective — Flag misordering where name is set only after initialization. Signals — Detect cases where the first assignment to <genpd>.name post-dominates the pm_genpd_init call (as in [PATCH_DIFF], where name assignment comes after the call pre-patch). FP mitigation — Require that there is no prior assignment to <genpd>.name on any path before pm_genpd_init.

6) Step 6: Objective — Flag missing initialization entirely when object is freshly zeroed. Signals — If no write to <genpd>.name exists in the function, and the containing object is allocated with zero-initialization (e.g., kzalloc, as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]) or explicitly memset to 0 before pm_genpd_init, then pm_genpd_init uses a NULL name (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation — Only flag if the genpd object is provably fresh and zeroed in the same function before pm_genpd_init; otherwise, refrain from reporting.

7) Step 7: Objective — Strengthen confidence that this is a PM domain registration/init context. Signals — Look for additional characteristic field assignments on the same genpd object (e.g., power_on/power_off callbacks as in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — Use this as an additional filter; if absent, lower the confidence or skip, reducing noise in unrelated contexts.

8) Step 8: Objective — Rule out alternative valid naming paths. Signals — If there is an explicit call that sets the embedded device’s name prior to pm_genpd_init (e.g., a function known to set dev_set_name on &genpd->dev), consider the case non-actionable since the core issue is a NULL device name (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]). FP mitigation — Only apply this exclusion when the call clearly targets the same embedded device object; otherwise, keep the finding.

9) Step 9: Objective — Output precise evidence with minimal paths. Signals — For each finding, report the pm_genpd_init call site and the first subsequent <genpd>.name assignment (or the fresh zeroed allocation site if no assignment exists) to reflect the ordering defect described in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]. FP mitigation — Require both anchor points (call site plus post-dominant name write or zeroed allocation) to avoid speculative reports.

3. Target Elements
- Call sites to pm_genpd_init.
- Field writes/assignments to generic_pm_domain.name.
- Allocation sites for the container or genpd object (e.g., kzalloc) and zero-initialization (e.g., memset to 0).
- Intra-procedural aliasing of the genpd object (e.g., &X->genpd assigned to a local pointer).
- Callback/capability assignments on the same genpd object (power_on, power_off) as contextual signals.
- Control-flow dominance/post-dominance relationships around the call and assignments.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the genpd object identity intra-procedurally from the pm_genpd_init argument through simple aliases (assignments to locals) and address-of field expressions to find the same object’s .name writes.
- Track freshness and zero-initialization flows: kzalloc/kvzalloc/devm_kzalloc or memset(..., 0, ...) on the containing object before pm_genpd_init imply name == NULL if not written.
- Use control-flow analysis (dominance) rather than value-range analysis to determine if a name write occurs before the call on all paths.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function allocates a container with kzalloc, calls pm_genpd_init(&obj->genpd, ...), and only afterwards sets obj->genpd.name = param; Expected: Report misordered initialization.
- Positive: A function calls pm_genpd_init(&obj->genpd, ...) without any assignment to obj->genpd.name, with obj freshly zeroed; Expected: Report missing initialization before init.
- Negative: A function sets obj->genpd.name = "foo" (or from a non-NULL param) before pm_genpd_init(&obj->genpd, ...); Expected: No report.
- Negative: pm_genpd_init called on a statically initialized global generic_pm_domain whose .name is set via a global initializer; Expected: No report (if the checker cannot prove global init, treat as “uncertain” and do not report).
- Test harness notes: Validate intra-procedural alias handling (e.g., gpd = &obj->genpd; gpd->name = name) and dominance across simple conditionals; add a case with early return branches to verify path sensitivity.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium-high: moderate implementation effort (alias + dominance + initializer context), high security impact due to kernel NULL dereference/DoS as described in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Name set in a callee before pm_genpd_init: mitigate by restricting to intra-procedural evidence and requiring clear absence of pre-call writes in the same function.
- Pre-initialized globals: mitigate by ignoring cases not involving fresh zeroed allocation or without contextual setup (e.g., power_on/off assignments).
- Alternative name-setting via device APIs: mitigate by excluding cases with explicit device name assignment prior to pm_genpd_init on the same embedded device.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes pm_genpd_init depends on genpd->name being set, per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; the checker does not model pm_genpd_init internals.
- Inter-procedural initialization of .name (via helper functions) is not fully analyzed; may cause false negatives or, if ignored, false positives in rare patterns.
- Global/static initialization of generic_pm_domain objects may not be reliably detected intra-procedurally.
- The checker targets the specific ordering flaw highlighted in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]; it does not detect downstream crashes in debugfs/devfs code paths.
