1. Plan Summary
Detect use-after-free in ath12k-like RX paths where fields of a control block derived from a sk_buff (via ATH12K_SKB_RXCB) are accessed after the sk_buff has been freed (e.g., via dev_kfree_skb_any), as in CVE-2025-38292.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — identify the freeing operation of interest; Signals — calls to dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) where skb is a struct sk_buff pointer (based on [FUNCTION_CONTENT] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); FP mitigation — require that the call’s argument is the same variable name used in subsequent logic and appears in a path without immediate reassignment.

2) Step 2: Objective — find interior/control-block pointers derived from skb; Signals — assignments where a variable (e.g., rxcb) is set from ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) (as shown in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); FP mitigation — ensure the macro/function argument is the same skb variable later freed.

3) Step 3: Objective — locate post-free dereferences of the interior pointer; Signals — field accesses on the derived pointer (e.g., rxcb->is_continuation) occurring after a dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) call on the same skb along a feasible control-flow path (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] description of UAF); FP mitigation — confirm there is no redefinition/assignment to rxcb between free and dereference.

4) Step 4: Objective — also catch re-derivation after free; Signals — any use of ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) again after dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) in the same iteration/path; FP mitigation — exclude cases where skb is reassigned a new value prior to re-derivation.

5) Step 5: Objective — prioritize loop-processing patterns typical of RX buffer coalescing; Signals — within loops that dequeue buffers (e.g., while ((skb = __skb_dequeue(...)) != NULL)), detect the sequence: derive rxcb from skb, perform work, free skb, then read rxcb to decide continuation/break (from [FUNCTION_CONTENT] lines after dev_kfree_skb_any and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); FP mitigation — require the dereference that drives a control decision (if (!rxcb->is_continuation) break) to occur after the free in the same loop iteration.

6) Step 6: Objective — recognize safe caching fixes to avoid false positives; Signals — a scalar local (e.g., bool is_continuation) assigned from rxcb->field before the free, with subsequent uses referencing only the scalar and not rxcb (as per [PATCH_DIFF] and [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]); FP mitigation — if all post-free decisions use only cached scalars, do not report.

7) Step 7: Objective — rule out pre-free checks that are safe; Signals — patterns where rxcb->field is read before dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) to decide whether to free or break (seen in the error path in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); FP mitigation — only flag dereferences that occur strictly after the free point on at least one path with no intervening reassignment.

8) Step 8: Objective — ensure path feasibility; Signals — verify that a control-flow path exists from the specific free call to the dereference without early return/break that would skip the dereference; FP mitigation — require presence of the dereference in the same basic block or a dominated successor of the free site within the loop/branch.

9) Step 9: Objective — handle multiple frees in the same block; Signals — if there are multiple calls to dev_kfree_skb_any, tie each free to the corresponding skb variable within that iteration and only flag dereferences tied to the freed instance; FP mitigation — use name and dataflow matching to avoid cross-iteration conflation.

10) Step 10: Objective — prioritize sk_buff/ATH12K_SKB_RXCB pattern to reduce noise; Signals — limit initial scope to cases where the interior pointer is obtained via ATH12K_SKB_RXCB and the free is dev_kfree_skb_any, matching [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; FP mitigation — this narrow signature avoids misclassifying unrelated frees or container/field patterns.

3. Target Elements
- Function bodies containing loops over sk_buff lists (e.g., while with __skb_dequeue).
- Call sites to dev_kfree_skb_any with a struct sk_buff* argument.
- Assignments deriving control-block pointers via ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb).
- Field accesses on the derived control-block pointer (e.g., rxcb->is_continuation).
- Conditional checks and loop break/continue decisions that reference these fields.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from skb to rxcb via ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) as an “interior pointer” derived from the container.
- Model dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) as invalidating both skb and any interior pointers derived from it.
- Flag uses (field reads, macro re-derivations) of rxcb or ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) after the invalidation on paths without re-assignment of skb/rxcb.
- Recognize “safe snapshots” where a scalar is assigned from rxcb->field before the free and only the scalar is used post-free.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch pattern from [FUNCTION_CONTENT]: inside the while loop, derive rxcb from ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb), call dev_kfree_skb_any(skb), then evaluate if (!rxcb->is_continuation) break — expect a report.
- Positive: Variant where ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) is called again after dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) to read a field — expect a report.
- Negative: Patched pattern from [PATCH_DIFF]: cache is_continuation before free and only use the cached scalar after dev_kfree_skb_any — expect no report.
- Negative: Error-path snippet in [FUNCTION_CONTENT] where rxcb->is_continuation is tested before dev_kfree_skb_any(skb) — expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Exercise intra-iteration paths, aliasing with multiple skb variables, and confirm domination/path checks distinguish pre- vs post-free uses.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium effort; High priority (use-after-free in kernel RX path per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] and [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- If dev_kfree_skb_any does not free under certain conditions: mitigate by requiring the post-free dereference to be in a path that assumes the call executed and by prioritizing same-iteration patterns.
- Aliasing/reassignment of skb/rxcb between free and dereference: mitigate by precise def-use/path checks and excluding cases with intervening reassignments.
- Macro resolution issues for ATH12K_SKB_RXCB: mitigate by ensuring the analysis can see macro calls or by also matching equivalent wrapper functions if visible.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes dev_kfree_skb_any frees the passed skb as per [FUNCTION_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; no broader free-modeling is included.
- Assumes ATH12K_SKB_RXCB(skb) yields a pointer into skb control block as per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; other cb access patterns are not covered.
- Interprocedural freeing or complex refcount semantics are not modeled beyond direct call patterns shown in the supplied code.
