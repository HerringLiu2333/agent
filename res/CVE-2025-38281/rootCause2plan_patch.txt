1. Plan Summary
Detect cases where the return value of devm_kasprintf() is used as the name in thermal_cooling_device_register() without a preceding NULL check, leading to potential kernel NULL pointer dereference (based on [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify in-function call sites where a variable is assigned from devm_kasprintf(). Signals: an assignment or initialization capturing the return of devm_kasprintf(&wiphy->dev, GFP_KERNEL, ...). FP mitigation: restrict to assignments in the same function scope as the subsequent use.
2) Step 2: For each such variable, locate a subsequent call to thermal_cooling_device_register() where that variable is passed as the name argument. Signals: the variable appears as the first argument in thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...). FP mitigation: require a control-flow path from the assignment to the call within the same function.
3) Step 3: Check for the presence of a NULL check on the variable before any path reaching thermal_cooling_device_register(). Signals: a conditional like if (!var) or var == NULL with an early abort (e.g., return -ENOMEM) guarding all paths to the sink. FP mitigation: require that the NULL-check blocks all feasible paths to the sink (path-sensitive).
4) Step 4: Flag cases where no such NULL check exists prior to the sink. Signals: unguarded use of the variable as the sink argument. FP mitigation: suppress if a prior check exists that dominates the sink.
5) Step 5: Track simple aliases of the devm_kasprintf() result (e.g., var2 = var1) used as the sink argument. Signals: direct assignments or parameter passing within the same function flowing to the sink. FP mitigation: limit to straightforward, intra-procedural flows to avoid speculative aliasing.
6) Step 6: Exclude cases where an explicit early return on NULL is present immediately after devm_kasprintf(). Signals: if (!var) return <error>; mirrors the fix in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation: ensure the early return occurs before any use and dominates the sink.
7) Step 7: Prefer reporting only when the variable is used as the "name" parameter of thermal_cooling_device_register(), as the root cause is tied to passing NULL into this API (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). Signals: argument position corresponds to the device name usage. FP mitigation: confirm argument position and not other parameters.

3. Target Elements
- Function bodies where devm_kasprintf() is called and its return is stored.
- Call sites of thermal_cooling_device_register() using the stored value as the name argument.
- Condition checks that compare the stored value to NULL and perform early returns.
- Control-flow paths from the allocation site to the sink call within the same function.
- Simple variable aliases between the allocation site and sink.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track intra-procedural dataflow from the devm_kasprintf() return value to the name argument of thermal_cooling_device_register().
- Respect control-flow guards: a NULL-check followed by an early return should cut off flows to the sink.
- Handle straightforward aliasing (assignments) of the name variable within the same function.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch pattern — name = devm_kasprintf(...); thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...); with no preceding if (!name) return ...; should be flagged (per [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Negative: Patched pattern — name = devm_kasprintf(...); if (!name) return -ENOMEM; thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...); should not be flagged (per [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Test harness notes: Run the checker on the mt7996_thermal_init() function before and after the patch; confirm one alert pre-patch and none post-patch.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium effort, high priority (broader hardening pattern across drivers as noted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Path-insensitive analysis missing dominating NULL checks; mitigate with path-sensitive dominance checks.
- Complex aliasing or inter-procedural flows causing uncertainty; mitigate by focusing on intra-procedural, simple assignments.
- Alternate defensive patterns (e.g., different error handling) not recognized as early abort; mitigate by accepting any branch that prevents reaching the sink when NULL.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes thermal_cooling_device_register() requires a non-NULL name and may dereference it, as stated in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; other sinks are not considered.
- Focused on devm_kasprintf() specifically; while [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] mentions broader devm_* and k*alloc* patterns, this plan does not enumerate additional APIs due to lack of explicit evidence.
- Inter-procedural guarantees and macro-based assertions are not analyzed due to insufficient information in the provided materials.
