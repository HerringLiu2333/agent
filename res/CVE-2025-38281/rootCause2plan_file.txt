1. Plan Summary
Detect unchecked devm_kasprintf return values that may be NULL and are subsequently used as string arguments to thermal/hwmon registration functions, causing potential NULL pointer dereferences (as in mt7996_thermal_init).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify allocation sites where devm_kasprintf is called and its return value is stored. Signals: Calls to devm_kasprintf with a variable assigned (e.g., name = devm_kasprintf(...)), as described in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [FILE_CONTENT]; FP mitigation: restrict to assignments to pointer-typed variables of char/const char.
2) Step 2: Objective: Model the allocated pointer variable and its subsequent use within the same function. Signals: Track the variable defined by the devm_kasprintf call through the function’s control flow; FP mitigation: limit to intra-procedural flows to avoid speculative cross-function assumptions.
3) Step 3: Objective: Identify sink calls that expect a valid string and are known in the scenario to dereference the pointer. Signals: Calls to thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...) and devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups(&dev, name, ...) with the tracked variable as an argument, per [FILE_CONTENT] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; FP mitigation: only treat these specific APIs as sinks in this checker.
4) Step 4: Objective: Determine if the devm_kasprintf result is checked for NULL before reaching any sink. Signals: Presence of a dominating conditional that tests the variable for null (e.g., if (!name) or name == NULL) with early error handling/return, as added in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation: require the check to syntactically guard all paths to the sink (dominance).
5) Step 5: Objective: Flag paths where the sink is reachable without any prior NULL check. Signals: Existence of a control-flow path from the allocation to the sink with no intervening null-test; FP mitigation: ignore paths that are infeasible due to constant conditions (basic constant propagation).
6) Step 6: Objective: Reduce false positives by confirming the variable is not reassigned to a non-NULL constant or validated via helper before the sink. Signals: Look for reassignments to string literals or validated copies, and for wrappers that ensure non-NULL; FP mitigation: if reassignment to a literal or check function (e.g., explicit ASSERT/BUG_ON on non-NULL) occurs before the sink, do not report.
7) Step 7: Objective: Confirm the usage context matches initialization/registration code where impact is critical. Signals: Functions that perform device registration or initialization (e.g., mt7996_thermal_init) per [FILE_CONTENT]; FP mitigation: prioritize findings in init-like functions but do not exclude others if sink usage is present.
8) Step 8: Objective: Highlight multiple unsafe uses of the same unchecked pointer. Signals: The variable flowing to more than one sink without checks (thermal_cooling_device_register and devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups), per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; FP mitigation: group related sinks under a single report to avoid duplication.
9) Step 9: Objective: Exclude cases where the sink call itself is conditional on the variable’s truthiness. Signals: Patterns like if (name) thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...); FP mitigation: treat such direct guarding as sufficient validation.
10) Step 10: Objective: Ensure reported issues map to the root cause of potential NULL dereference in kernel drivers. Signals: Pointer returned by devm_kasprintf can be NULL (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]) and is passed into sinks that likely dereference; FP mitigation: only consider devm_kasprintf as a source in this checker.

3. Target Elements
- Function calls to devm_kasprintf with assigned results.
- Variables of type char* or const char* holding the allocation result.
- Call sites: thermal_cooling_device_register and devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups using the allocated name.
- Condition checks comparing the allocated variable to NULL or negation (!var).
- Intra-function control-flow and dominance between check and sink.
- Variable reassignments and guarding conditions.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the pointer produced by devm_kasprintf to its uses as arguments in sink functions.
- Require that a NULL-check dominates the sink; absence indicates unsafe flow.
- Stop tracking if the variable is reassigned to a known non-NULL literal or validated copy.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function similar to mt7996_thermal_init where name = devm_kasprintf(...); is followed by thermal_cooling_device_register(name, ...) and devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups(&dev, name, ...) with no preceding if (!name) check (expect: report).
- Negative: Same function but with the patch-like guard if (!name) return -ENOMEM; placed immediately after devm_kasprintf and before any sink (expect: no report).
- Negative: Sink calls guarded by if (name) { ...sink(name)... } (expect: no report).
- Test harness notes: Run on the pre-patch file content to ensure detection, and on the patched diff to ensure suppression.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Sinks that legitimately accept NULL: mitigate by restricting sinks to the two APIs evidenced in [FILE_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Checks performed in indirect helpers not modeled: mitigate via intra-procedural focus and recognition of direct guarding conditions.
- Infeasible paths due to constant conditions: mitigate with simple constant/dominance analysis.
- Variables reassigned to safe values before sinks: mitigate by tracking reassignments and excluding such cases.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes devm_kasprintf may return NULL, as stated in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]; other allocators are not covered.
- Assumes thermal_cooling_device_register and devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups will dereference the name (based on [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); the checker treats them as non-NULL-required sinks.
- Does not analyze inter-procedural checks (e.g., helper functions ensuring non-NULL), potentially missing validations outside the current function.
- Generalization to other similar sinks is not attempted due to lack of evidence in supplied materials.
