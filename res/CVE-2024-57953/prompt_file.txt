1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57953

2. Vulnerability Type
Integer overflow due to incorrect integer promotion (32-bit intermediate multiplication)

3. Root Cause Summary
On 32-bit systems, the multiplication in tps6594_rtc_set_offset() used two 32-bit operands, causing a 32-bit intermediate overflow before assignment to a 64-bit s64. Specifically, TICKS_PER_HOUR was defined as an int-valued macro (32768 * 3600), and offset is a long (32-bit on 32-bit arch). The expression “tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;” thus overflowed in 32-bit arithmetic, yielding an incorrect calibration value or error. The patch corrects the type by making TICKS_PER_HOUR a 64-bit constant (LL), ensuring 64-bit multiplication and preventing overflow.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
RTC driver for TPS6594 PMIC (drivers/rtc/rtc-tps6594.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- TICKS_PER_HOUR defined as “(32768 * 3600)” (int), used in tps6594_rtc_set_offset().
- In tps6594_rtc_set_offset(), the line:
  tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;
  performs 32-bit multiplication on 32-bit systems (offset: long, TICKS_PER_HOUR: int), overflowing before storing into s64 tmp.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Any invocation of .set_offset on a 32-bit system with a non-zero offset within the allowed range [-277774, 277774].
- The product offset * 117,964,800 exceeds 32-bit limits, causing overflow during the multiply.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Wrong intermediate result propagates to tmp and subsequently to the computed calibration value (cast to int and passed to tps6594_rtc_set_calibration()).
- Results in incorrect calibration being programmed or undesired -ERANGE from tps6594_rtc_set_calibration(), effectively breaking the offset feature (functional integrity/DoS of feature), not memory corruption.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Force 64-bit arithmetic by redefining TICKS_PER_HOUR as a 64-bit constant so the multiply is done in 64-bit, preventing overflow on 32-bit systems.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Change:
  #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600)
  to:
  #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600LL)
- This ensures offset (long) is multiplied by a long long, producing a 64-bit intermediate for tmp (s64).

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The patch only adjusts constant typing to correct arithmetic width; no locking or ordering changes.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Highlights the importance of constant typing and integer promotion rules in cross-architecture code, especially where 32-bit builds are supported.
- Similar arithmetic conversions in other drivers should ensure 64-bit intermediates when large scale factors are used.
- Prevents silent logic errors that can degrade device functionality or expose user-visible reliability issues.
