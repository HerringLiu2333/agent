1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57953

2. Vulnerability Type
Integer overflow due to insufficient type width and incorrect integer promotion in arithmetic

3. Root Cause Summary
The macro TICKS_PER_HOUR was defined as (32768 * 3600), which is of type int. In tps6594_rtc_set_offset(), the expression tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR was evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic on 32-bit systems because offset is a long (32-bit there) and TICKS_PER_HOUR is int, leading to a 32-bit intermediate result. This intermediate multiplication overflows for |offset| > ~18 since TICKS_PER_HOUR ≈ 117,964,800, corrupting the value before it is assigned to the s64 tmp. The patch changes TICKS_PER_HOUR to (32768 * 3600LL), forcing 64-bit arithmetic and eliminating the overflow.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
RTC subsystem, TPS6594 RTC driver (drivers/rtc/rtc-tps6594.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- TICKS_PER_HOUR defined as an int-sized constant, causing 32-bit multiplication with a 32-bit long on 32-bit architectures.
- In tps6594_rtc_set_offset(), the code “tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;” performs the multiply in 32 bits, despite tmp being s64, so the overflow occurs before assignment.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Building/running on 32-bit systems.
- Calling tps6594_rtc_set_offset() with offset magnitude greater than approximately 18 (well within the documented range up to MAX_OFFSET 277774), causing the 32-bit product to exceed INT32/LONG32 bounds.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- The overflowed intermediate result wraps modulo 2^32 and is then stored in s64, yielding an incorrect tmp.
- This leads to misprogramming of the RTC offset/frequency correction, causing erroneous timekeeping adjustments and potentially large time drift or incorrect RTC behavior.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Ensure 64-bit arithmetic in the multiplication by widening the constant, so the compiler promotes operands to 64-bit before performing the operation.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Change macro definition:
  - From: #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600)
  - To:   #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600LL)
- This forces TICKS_PER_HOUR to be long long, making offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR computed in 64-bit and safely stored in s64 tmp.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The patch only changes constant type to correct arithmetic width; no locking or ordering changes are involved.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- While not a memory-safety issue, incorrect time offset programming can lead to significant timekeeping errors, affecting logs, timers, and time-based controls.
- Erroneous RTC adjustments can undermine system reliability and may impact security mechanisms relying on accurate time (e.g., certificate validation windows, scheduled tasks).
- Highlights the importance of using appropriately wide types for large constants and cross-architecture integer promotion to prevent silent arithmetic corruption.
