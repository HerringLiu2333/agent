1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-57953

2. Vulnerability Type
Integer overflow due to 32-bit arithmetic promotion

3. Root Cause Summary
In tps6594_rtc_set_offset(), the product tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR was computed using 32-bit arithmetic on 32-bit builds because TICKS_PER_HOUR was defined as (32768 * 3600) (an int-typed constant). Although tmp is s64, C performs the multiplication in the type of the operands; with offset being long (32-bit on 32-bit systems) and TICKS_PER_HOUR as int, the intermediate result overflowed 32-bit before being assigned to s64. This led to wraparound and incorrect tmp values used to program the RTC offset.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
RTC subsystem, TPS6594 RTC driver (drivers/rtc/rtc-tps6594.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- The macro TICKS_PER_HOUR was defined as (32768 * 3600), which is an int-sized constant.
- In tps6594_rtc_set_offset(), tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR computed the product in 32-bit on 32-bit systems (offset is long), causing overflow before assignment to s64.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Any 32-bit build invoking tps6594_rtc_set_offset() with an offset magnitude large enough that offset * 117,964,800 exceeds INT_MAX (~2.147e9), i.e., |offset| ≳ 19.
- Given the driver’s allowed range (MAX_OFFSET 277774), many valid offsets would trigger the overflow.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- The 32-bit overflow produces a wrapped/truncated result that is then stored in s64 tmp, yielding incorrect sign/magnitude.
- This erroneous tmp propagates to RTC offset register programming, resulting in incorrect time offset adjustments (time skew, misconfiguration). Memory safety impact is not indicated.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Force 64-bit arithmetic for the multiplication by making TICKS_PER_HOUR a 64-bit constant, ensuring the product is computed in at least 64-bit width and fits within s64.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Changed definition:
  - Before: #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600)
  - After:  #define TICKS_PER_HOUR (32768 * 3600LL)
- This change ensures offset (long) is promoted to long long and the multiplication does not overflow on 32-bit systems.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch only alters constant type to correct arithmetic width; no synchronization or ordering changes.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Cross-architecture arithmetic width mismatches (32-bit vs 64-bit) can silently cause overflows and logic faults despite using wider destination types; constants must enforce correct promotion.
- Large scaling factors (e.g., ticks per hour) require explicit 64-bit constants or casts to avoid intermediate overflow.
- Similar time/scale conversions across drivers should be audited for implicit 32-bit arithmetic, especially where user or configuration inputs are multiplied by large constants.
