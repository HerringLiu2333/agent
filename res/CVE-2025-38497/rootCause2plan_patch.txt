1. Plan Summary
Detect out-of-bounds reads caused by indexing the last byte of an input buffer (page[len-1] or equivalent) in configfs/sysfs store handlers without first validating that the input length is non-zero.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify candidate store handlers. Signals — Functions that take a buffer pointer parameter (e.g., const char *page) and a length parameter (e.g., size_t len), as seen in webusb_landingPage_store and os_desc_qw_sign_store (based on [PATCH_DIFF]); optionally return ssize_t and accept a struct config_item * parameter. FP mitigation — Prefer functions whose names end with _store and/or include a configfs-related parameter type to match [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] scope.

2) Step 2: Objective — Capture index variables derived from the length. Signals — Local variables assigned directly from len (e.g., int l = len) or capped via min_t-like constructs (e.g., l = min_t(int, len, CONST)) as shown in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Restrict to simple, monotonic derivations that do not add positive offsets before the dereference (assign, cast, min_t/int conversion).

3) Step 3: Objective — Find last-byte access patterns on the input buffer. Signals — Array indexing or pointer arithmetic that reads from page[X - 1], where X is len or a variable dataflow-dependent on len, as in page[l - 1] (from [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation — Require that the access is a read (e.g., used in a comparison like == '\n' per [PATCH_DIFF]) to match the root cause.

4) Step 4: Objective — Ensure the potential zero-length case reaches the read. Signals — Absence of a dominating control-flow guard that ensures len > 0 or the derived index variable > 0 before the page[X - 1] read; specifically missing an early return on !len like the fix “if (!len) return len;” (from [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation — Use control-flow dominance/path-feasibility: if there is any guaranteed guard (e.g., if (len) { ... } wrapping the access or an early return on !len), do not flag.

5) Step 5: Objective — Account for capped length derivations that can still be zero. Signals — Derived index variable computed as min_t(int, len, CONST) (from [PATCH_DIFF]) and then used as page[l - 1]; recognize that this remains zero when len == 0. FP mitigation — If there is a guard on the derived variable (e.g., if (l > 0)), treat as safe.

6) Step 6: Objective — Recognize typical newline-stripping pattern as a high-confidence subtype. Signals — Conditional of the form if (page[IDX - 1] == '\n') followed by decrementing IDX (e.g., --l) and possibly bookkeeping like bytes_to_strip (from [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation — Elevate confidence for this exact pattern; demote or exclude cases where the same condition is protected by a len/IDX > 0 check.

7) Step 7: Objective — Track aliases of the buffer pointer and index variable. Signals — Simple assignments that copy page to another pointer or len to another variable used in the read, consistent with the local code shapes in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Limit to intra-procedural aliases and straightforward copies to reduce noise.

8) Step 8: Objective — Exclude safe index adjustments that guarantee positivity before access. Signals — Preceding code that reduces l (e.g., --l) after verifying l > 0, or any arithmetic that enforces l >= 1 prior to page[l - 1]. FP mitigation — Require that any decrement or use of l - 1 is dominated by a check ensuring l > 0; otherwise flag.

9) Step 9: Objective — Prioritize configfs/sysfs attribute contexts. Signals — Presence of struct config_item * parameter and conventional page/len parameters as in the affected subsystem (from [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation — If available, prefer functions inside USB gadget configfs code paths or named attributes like landingPage/qw_sign for highest confidence; otherwise keep severity lower but still report.

10) Step 10: Objective — Suppress cases where len is known non-zero by contract within the function. Signals — Immediate reassignment from a non-zero constant, or explicit earlier checks that normalize zero to one before use. FP mitigation — If dataflow proves len-derived index cannot be zero on any path reaching the read, suppress.

3. Target Elements
- Functions with signatures including (struct config_item *, const char *page, size_t len) and returning ssize_t.
- Parameters representing input buffer and its length (page and len).
- Local variables derived from len (e.g., l) via assignment or min_t.
- Array index expressions reading page[expr] where expr is (len - 1) or (l - 1).
- Conditional checks comparing the last byte (e.g., == '\n') and subsequent length adjustments.
- Control-flow guards and early returns that ensure len > 0 or l > 0.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track intra-procedural dataflow from len to derived index variables used in indexing; include direct assignment, casts, and min_t capping.
- Treat min_t with len as an argument as a non-increasing transformation preserving zero.
- Track simple pointer/variable aliases of page and l.
- Path sensitivity: determine whether any path to the read lacks a dominating len > 0 or l > 0 guard.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function like webusb_landingPage_store(...) with int l = len; if (page[l - 1] == '\n') --l; without any prior if (!len) return; Expected: flagged.
- Positive: A function like os_desc_qw_sign_store(...) with l = min_t(int, len, CONST); if (page[l - 1] == '\n') --l; without a len/l > 0 guard. Expected: flagged.
- Negative: Same functions with the fix applied: if (!len) return len; before any page[l - 1] access. Expected: not flagged.
- Negative: Code that wraps the access in if (l > 0) { if (page[l - 1] == '\n') ... } or if (len) { ... page[len - 1] ... }. Expected: not flagged.
- Test harness notes: Validate both direct len - 1 and derived l - 1 patterns; include cases with and without min_t; verify path-sensitivity by adding alternate guarded branches.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires intra-procedural dataflow and path-sensitive guard analysis, but with constrained patterns as evidenced in [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Functions where len cannot be zero due to external API contracts not visible in the function body; mitigate by requiring in-function guards or accept lower confidence.
- Complex derivations of l from len that implicitly ensure positivity; mitigate by focusing on simple direct/min_t derivations.
- Non-store contexts using similar patterns intentionally with prior unseen checks; mitigate by restricting to store-like signatures and names.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes page is the input buffer corresponding to len; inferred from [PATCH_DIFF], not universally guaranteed elsewhere.
- Assumes min_t semantics are known as a non-increasing cap; other capping helpers are not covered by evidence.
- Scope is centered on configfs-style store handlers in USB gadget code as per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; applicability beyond this pattern may require broader heuristics not evidenced here.
- Inter-procedural guarantees (e.g., caller ensuring len > 0) are not modeled; analysis is intra-procedural per evidence.
