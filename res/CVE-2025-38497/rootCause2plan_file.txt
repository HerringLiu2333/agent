1. Plan Summary
Detect out-of-bounds reads caused by accessing buffer[len_or_derived - 1] without first proving that the length is non-zero, focusing on configfs/sysfs store handlers similar to the WebUSB/os_desc cases.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify candidate store handlers — functions named with a “_store” suffix and having parameters (const char* buffer, size_t len), as seen in the affected functions (based on FILE_CONTENT). Reduce FPs by prioritizing Linux configfs/sysfs patterns: three-parameter store with names like webusb_*_store, os_desc_*_store (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

2) Step 2: Model length variables — collect the size_t len parameter and variables derived from it by assignment or via length-limiting patterns (e.g., l = len; l = min(len, C); l = min_t(int, len, …)), as present in webusb_landingPage_store and os_desc_qw_sign_store (FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). Reduce FPs by restricting “derived” to dataflow within the same function and to common idioms (min/min_t and direct assignment) observed in the patch context.

3) Step 3: Find risky dereferences — locate array indexing or pointer dereference of the input buffer where index is (v - 1) and v is len or a derived variable (e.g., page[l - 1], page[len - 1]) used for newline stripping or checks (FILE_CONTENT: webusb_landingPage_store, os_desc_qw_sign_store, ext_prop_data_store, interf_grp_*_store). Reduce FPs by requiring that the buffer operand aliases the “page”-like parameter.

4) Step 4: Check dominance of zero-length guards — require that before the risky dereference, there is no dominating control-flow check proving v > 0 or len > 0 (e.g., if (!len) return), which the patch adds (PATCH_DIFF; ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). Reduce FPs by performing dominance analysis: if a guard like if (len == 0) return; or if (v <= 0) return; dominates the dereference, suppress the alert.

5) Step 5: Account for min-based derivations — treat v = min(len, K) (including min_t) as potentially zero if len can be zero, so page[v - 1] is unsafe absent a guard (FILE_CONTENT: os_desc_qw_sign_store, interf_grp_*_store; ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). Reduce FPs by excluding cases where there is a dominating guard proving len >= 1.

6) Step 6: Recognize common trailing-character patterns — prioritize reports when the comparison is to '\n' or '\0' (e.g., if (page[v - 1] == '\n')) since that matches the root cause and patch intent (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT). Reduce FPs by scoring higher severity for this idiom and lower for other char comparisons.

7) Step 7: Track simple transformations of v — allow v to be adjusted after the risky access (e.g., --l) but ensure the flagged access occurs before any decrement (FILE_CONTENT). Reduce FPs by only reporting dereferences that precede any decrement of the same variable in the CFG path.

8) Step 8: Verify buffer identity — ensure the dereferenced array is the input buffer (page or kstrdup(page) clone) and the index flows from len; in gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store, name is derived from page and indexed by len - 1 (FILE_CONTENT). Reduce FPs by allowing one-level copies (e.g., kmemdup/kstrdup) when the index still uses len.

9) Step 9: Multi-branch coverage — if the dereference is inside a conditional, verify that no preceding branch on all feasible paths guarantees len > 0 before reaching the dereference. Reduce FPs by using path feasibility checks so that a single guarded path does not mask unguarded paths.

10) Step 10: Report with context — include which variable (len or derived) indexed at -1, where it was assigned from len, and the absence of dominating guards, aligning with the patch’s added “if (!len) return” (PATCH_DIFF). Reduce FPs by suppressing duplicates when multiple dereferences share the same root cause within a function.

3. Target Elements
- Functions: configfs/sysfs store handlers (name ends with “_store”) taking (const char* page, size_t len).
- Parameters and local variables: len and variables assigned from len or min/min_t with len.
- Array indexing expressions and pointer dereferences on the input buffer (e.g., page[v - 1], name[len - 1]).
- Condition checks and early returns that guard len or derived variables.
- Simple buffer clones derived from the input (e.g., kstrdup(page), kmemdup(page, len)) indexed by len-1.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Treat len as the “length source” and propagate into local variables via assignment, min/min_t, and simple arithmetic.
- Track the specific buffer parameter (page) and immediate clones as “buffer sinks.”
- Flag uses where the index expression equals (v - 1) and v dataflows from len, without a dominating guard proving v > 0 or len > 0.
- Consider intra-procedural flow; inter-procedural not required for this pattern.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch webusb_landingPage_store and os_desc_qw_sign_store accessing page[l - 1] before checking len > 0 (FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Positive: ext_prop_data_store using page[len - 1] without a len > 0 guard; interf_grp_compatible_id_store using l = min(8, len); if (page[l - 1] == '\n') (FILE_CONTENT).
- Negative: Post-patch versions with early “if (!len) return len;” dominating the dereference (PATCH_DIFF).
- Test harness notes: Build minimal compilable stubs for these functions with the relevant signatures and access patterns; verify that guarded variants are not flagged and unguarded ones are flagged.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires control-flow dominance and simple intra-procedural dataflow over common kernel idioms (min_t) but no deep inter-procedural analysis.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Call-site guarantees that len > 0 not expressible in code: mitigate by restricting to store-like handlers and requiring absence of in-function guards.
- Complex macro expansions hiding guards: mitigate by dominance analysis on the preprocessed AST where available.
- Non-input buffers indexed by len-1: mitigate by requiring the buffer to be the page parameter or a direct clone.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes no external contract guarantees len > 0 on store handlers (consistent with ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Does not model all possible derivations of v from len beyond straightforward assignments and min/min_t; may miss exotic arithmetic.
- Macro modeling (min_t) is assumed to be visible to dataflow; if not, treat min-like wrappers heuristically.
- Kernel-specific naming and signatures (page, len, *_store) are assumed based on FILE_CONTENT; patterns with different names may be missed.
