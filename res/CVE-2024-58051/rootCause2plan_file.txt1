1. Plan Summary
Insufficient vulnerability-specific information is provided; thus only a generic, patch-differencing-driven detection strategy can be outlined.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Determine availability of concrete signals — check the provided sections for any function names, APIs, files, conditions, or code snippets that characterize the flaw and its fix.
2) Step 2: Extract the fix pattern — identify added or strengthened checks (e.g., null/Bounds/permission/locking/format/taint validation), early returns, or sanitizer calls introduced around a sensitive operation in the patch.
3) Step 3: Derive the pre-patch bug condition — conceptually negate or remove the fix and define the unsafe state as reaching the sensitive operation without the added guard/sanitizer/lock.
4) Step 4: Identify the sensitive operation (sink) — from the patch, locate the API call, data write, memory access, or security-relevant action that is now guarded.
5) Step 5: Identify untrusted inputs (sources) — from the description/patch, enumerate parameters, environment inputs, IPC/network data, or user-controlled fields that flow into the sink.
6) Step 6: Identify recognized sanitizers/guards — list the exact checks or functions added in the patch that must be present to make a path safe.
7) Step 7: Scope analysis to impacted symbols — limit matching to functions/files/classes explicitly referenced by the patch/description to reduce noise.
8) Step 8: Match missing-guard patterns — find call sites or code paths that invoke the sink when the required guard is absent or provably not dominating the sink.
9) Step 9: Perform path-sensitive dominance checks — ensure that along feasible control-flow paths to the sink, the fix condition does not hold or the guarding check is unreachable.
10) Step 10: Perform taint/dataflow checks — where relevant, find flows from identified sources to the sink that do not pass through the recognized sanitizers.
11) Step 11: Exclude post-patch safe cases — suppress findings where the guard/sanitizer is present and dominates the sink, or where validation strength matches the fix semantics.
12) Step 12: Report pre-patch-equivalent findings — highlight locations and paths that mirror the unsafe condition defined in Step 3 with references to the implicated symbols.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, FILE_CONTENT, or ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS details were provided; therefore, specific sources, sinks, guards, and symbol names cannot be enumerated.
- The plan assumes the patch introduces explicit guards/sanitizers around a discernible sensitive operation; if the fix is a semantic change (e.g., algorithmic redesign), the approach may not apply.
- The plan presumes that untrusted sources and sanitizers are identifiable from the missing materials; without them, the checker cannot be concretized.
