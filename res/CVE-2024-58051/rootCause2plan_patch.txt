1. Plan Summary
Generic, diff-driven detection plan to flag pre-patch patterns once the concrete root cause and patch changes are known; current materials lack any technical detail, so steps are conditional and intended to be instantiated when [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify the semantic change introduced by the fix — Signals: Compare modified functions/blocks in [PATCH_DIFF] to extract added conditions, error checks, sanitization, bounds checks, permission checks, or locking — FP mitigation: None possible now; requires actual [PATCH_DIFF] (not provided).
2) Step 2: Objective: Scope the affected APIs and call sites — Signals: List functions, methods, or modules touched in [PATCH_DIFF]; map their callers and transitive usages — FP mitigation: Restrict to call sites in the same component/module changed by the patch.
3) Step 3: Objective: If the patch adds a missing precondition or validation, detect uses lacking this gate — Signals: Look for data flows where a parameter or field is used in sink operations without the newly added predicate/guard present on that path — FP mitigation: Require structural equivalence to the added check (e.g., same variable and comparison pattern) and dominance of the check in the CFG.
4) Step 4: Objective: If the patch adds error/NULL/negative return handling, detect unchecked/ignored return values — Signals: Find calls to the modified function where the return is used without a check matching the newly introduced condition or is discarded — FP mitigation: Exclude sites where equivalent checks exist via wrapper helpers or immediate error propagation.
5) Step 5: Objective: If the patch adds bounds/length checks, detect unbounded memory/string/array operations — Signals: Identify flows from untrusted or variable-size inputs to memcpy/str*/indexing without a prior size/length comparison added by the patch — FP mitigation: Require that the size expression is data-dependent on the same variable as in the patch and that no defensive wrapper is used.
6) Step 6: Objective: If the patch adds input sanitization/normalization, detect unsanitized flows to sensitive sinks — Signals: Model the sanitizer introduced in [PATCH_DIFF] and flag paths where the same source reaches sinks without passing through it — FP mitigation: Accept alternative sanitizers if they provide equivalent property (e.g., range clamp vs. explicit validate).
7) Step 7: Objective: If the patch adds capability/permission checks, detect operations lacking them — Signals: Identify security/ACL predicates added in [PATCH_DIFF]; flag code paths invoking privileged operations without dominance by such checks — FP mitigation: Recognize equivalent authorization helpers and role-check abstractions.
8) Step 8: Objective: If the patch adds locking/synchronization, find accesses lacking the guard — Signals: Extract lock acquire/release pairs or atomic patterns added; flag reads/writes to the same shared state without the lock or memory ordering — FP mitigation: Exclude paths proven single-threaded or guarded by alternative but equivalent locks.
9) Step 9: Objective: If the patch adds integer overflow/underflow checks, detect arithmetic used in allocations/offsets without checks — Signals: Track arithmetic feeding allocation size, indexing, or pointer arithmetic; verify presence of overflow checks similar to the patch — FP mitigation: Recognize safe helpers (e.g., checked_add) and constant-bounded expressions.
10) Step 10: Objective: If the patch adds path/domain-specific validation (e.g., protocol/state check), flag transitions missing it — Signals: Model new state predicates or protocol version guards; find operations executed without those preconditions — FP mitigation: Respect equivalent state-machine encodings or invariants enforced by constructors.
11) Step 11: Objective: Localize to pre-patch flaw patterns — Signals: Use the exact syntactic/semantic delta from [PATCH_DIFF] (operator, constants, function names) to build matchers for “missing-before-fix” contexts — FP mitigation: Require close structural similarity to reduce incidental matches.
12) Step 12: Objective: Prioritize high-impact instances — Signals: Rank findings where unvalidated data reaches memory, I/O, privilege-affecting APIs, or cross-trust boundaries — FP mitigation: Downrank cases with defensive layers or non-exploitable contexts.

3. Target Elements
- Functions/methods modified by the patch and their transitive callers.
- Condition checks added or changed (comparisons, null checks, error checks).
- Return-value handling sites and error propagation logic.
- Allocation sites, buffer operations, pointer arithmetic, and array indexing.
- Lock acquisition/release sites and shared-state accesses.
- Input sanitization/validation helpers and their use sites.
- Permission/authorization checks and privileged operation call sites.
- State-machine transitions or protocol/version guards.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track data from sources referenced in the patch (parameters/fields) to sensitive sinks introduced/impacted by the change.
- Model sanitizers/validators added by the patch as guards; taint is cleared only when passing through equivalent checks.
- For concurrency, track accesses to the same memory locations with/without the lock added by the patch.
- For error-handling, track the propagation and checking of return values from modified functions to their immediate uses.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch example where a function uses an input directly in a sink (e.g., copy/index/privileged call) without the specific check/sanitizer/lock that the patch later adds; the checker flags it.
- Negative: A similar example where the input is validated using the same or an equivalent guard, return value is checked, or access is within the correct lock; the checker does not flag it.
- Test harness notes: Instantiate concrete checks once [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available; create minimal variants to test equivalence recognition (aliases, wrappers, inlined vs helper use).

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: Building a diff-driven, pattern-instantiation checker is straightforward, but accurate guard equivalence and dataflow require careful modeling once specifics are known.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative but equivalent validations not textually identical to the patch; mitigate by recognizing common helper APIs and logical equivalence patterns.
- Contexts where inputs are constrained by invariants (constructors, deserialization frameworks); mitigate by modeling those as sanitizers.
- Single-threaded or immutable contexts flagged by a generic lock checker; mitigate by detecting thread-confinement and immutability.
- Error checks performed in wrappers rather than at the immediate call site; mitigate by interprocedural analysis of wrappers.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] content was provided; concrete vulnerability class and signals are unknown.
- All steps are conditional templates to be instantiated once the actual patch/root cause is available.
- Assumes the fix introduces explicit, detectable semantic changes (guards, checks, locks, sanitizers) that can be mirrored as “missing-before-fix” patterns.
- Cannot determine specific sources/sinks, APIs, or languages involved without the missing materials.
