1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence was provided to determine the specific vulnerability mechanics; the plan outlines a patch-diff-driven, guard-pattern extraction approach to detect similar pre-patch flaws once [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify what the patch introduced (e.g., checks, guards, synchronization, error handling) by reviewing [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; without these, no concrete signals can be defined. FP mitigation — Defer concrete signal selection until the patch-derived pattern is known.

2) Step 2: Objective — Infer the precondition(s) that the patch enforces (nullability, bounds limits, state/lock requirements, permission, input sanitization). Signals — Look for newly added conditions, early returns, error checks, lock operations, or input normalization in [PATCH_DIFF]; they map to root cause by encoding safety preconditions. FP mitigation — Restrict to the exact functions/modules/classes touched by the patch and APIs mentioned in [FUNCTION_CONTENT].

3) Step 3: Objective — Define a pre-patch anti-pattern: usage sites performing the risky operation without the newly added guard. Signals — Same operation or API call sequence as in patched code but lacking the corresponding conditional, lock, sanitizer, or return-value handling. FP mitigation — Require structural similarity (same callee/API, similar arguments, same resource) and proximal location (same file/subsystem) to reduce spurious matches.

4) Step 4: Objective — Model the “guard-to-sink” relationship. Signals — A sink (dereference, buffer access, stateful operation, privileged call) that is preceded by the guard in patched code but not preceded by any equivalent guard in pre-patch code paths. FP mitigation — Use control-flow awareness: only flag when sink is reachable without the guard along at least one path.

5) Step 5: Objective — Capture error-return handling changes. Signals — Patch adds checks of return values or errno; pre-patch sites call the same functions and ignore or misuse failure codes. FP mitigation — Whitelist functions known to be pure or non-failing per [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and require that ignored returns are documented as needing checks in the patch.

6) Step 6: Objective — Capture bounds/length checks introduced by the patch. Signals — Patch adds comparisons between indexes/lengths/sizes; flag similar buffer/memory/string operations without those checks. FP mitigation — Require that the index/length is tainted by external input or variable that the patch guards, as indicated by the diff.

7) Step 7: Objective — Capture null/invalid-pointer guards added by the patch. Signals — Patch adds null/validity checks; flag dereferences or member accesses on the same variables without checks. FP mitigation — Exclude variables proven non-null (e.g., created by allocation that aborts on failure) per [FUNCTION_CONTENT], if present.

8) Step 8: Objective — Capture synchronization/locking added by the patch. Signals — Patch introduces lock/unlock around shared resource; flag accesses to the same resource outside of lock scope. FP mitigation — Confirm the resource identity (same field/object/global) and that the code path is concurrent as hinted by [FUNCTION_CONTENT].

9) Step 9: Objective — Capture input sanitization added by the patch. Signals — Patch adds canonicalization/validation (range, format, path) prior to sensitive use; flag uses of the same input without sanitation. FP mitigation — Only consider inputs marked or implied as external/user-controlled per patch or function comments.

10) Step 10: Objective — Scope to the affected subsystem. Signals — Limit search to files, namespaces, classes, or modules referenced in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]. FP mitigation — This focus minimizes cross-module false positives where patterns are intentionally different.

11) Step 11: Objective — Ensure semantic equivalence of guards. Signals — Check type and operand equivalence (same variable, same property checked) between the patch’s guard and candidate sites. FP mitigation — Do not flag when an alternative guard provides an equivalent safety guarantee (e.g., prevalidated constructor invariant).

12) Step 12: Objective — Rank and filter findings. Signals — Prioritize paths where the sink is directly influenced by inputs or states implicated in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; deprioritize defensive duplicates. FP mitigation — Require evidence of reachability and absence of any equivalent guard in all feasible paths.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified or mentioned in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT].
- Call sites to APIs whose handling changed in the patch.
- Condition checks added in the patch and corresponding pre-patch code paths lacking them.
- Lock boundaries and shared resource accesses introduced in the patch.
- Uses of function return values and error handling patterns changed by the patch.
- Buffer/memory/string operations that gained bounds checks.
- Pointer dereferences and member accesses that gained null/validity checks.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from inputs/variables guarded by the patch to sinks (dereferences, buffer accesses, privileged/stateful operations).
- Model control-flow: sinks reachable without the guard on at least one path.
- Model interprocedural propagation where the patch adds checks in callers vs. callees; detect call sites lacking equivalent checks.
- Treat variables flagged by patch guards as taint sources; ensure guard presence before their use in sinks.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch code path performing the same risky operation/API call without the guard introduced by the patch (e.g., missing null/bounds/error check) in the same function/subsystem.
- Negative: A code path with an equivalent guard already in place (e.g., validated constructor, invariant enforcement, or earlier check that dominates the sink).
- Test harness notes: Use the exact patched function as ground truth to define guards; construct a sibling function or earlier revision lacking the guard and verify detection; verify suppression when an equivalent check dominates the sink.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — final specificity depends on accessing [PATCH_DIFF]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; the framework is straightforward once signals are known.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Alternative equivalent guards not syntactically identical; mitigate via dominance and semantic equivalence checks.
- Non-failing or safe APIs misclassified as requiring checks; mitigate via function semantics in [FUNCTION_CONTENT].
- Contextual differences across modules; mitigate by scoping to patched subsystem.
- Guards moved to earlier layers (e.g., caller-side validation); mitigate by interprocedural guard detection.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were not provided; exact vulnerability class and signals cannot be determined.
- Assumes the patch introduces observable guard patterns (checks, locks, error handling) from which pre-patch anti-patterns can be derived.
- Cannot assert specific APIs, data types, or resources implicated in CVE-2024-58051 without the missing materials.
