1. Plan Summary
Insufficient information to determine the specific vulnerability class for CVE-2024-58051; no ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, or FILE_CONTENT usable content was provided. The plan below outlines a generic, patch-driven detection strategy template to be concretized once the missing inputs are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — identify the semantic change that fixed the issue in the patch (e.g., added guard, new return-value check, resource handling, bounds/type/permission checks). Signals — compare pre/post to find newly added conditions, error paths, or resource management; map to affected functions/fields/calls. FP mitigation — require the pattern be consistently applied across all modified sites in the patch.
2) Step 2: Objective — derive the pre-patch “bad pattern” from the fix (missing check or incorrect ordering). Signals — identify use sites where the patched guard or ordering is absent around the same function calls, parameters, or fields. FP mitigation — ensure contextual equivalence (same API, same operand/variable roles, and similar control-flow location).
3) Step 3: Objective — if a return-value check was added, detect unchecked uses pre-patch. Signals — uses of a function’s return without prior null/error/bounds validation (as implied by patch); early-return or error-handling introduced in patch indicates the intended check. FP mitigation — exclude cases where validation is in a dominating branch or encapsulated in called helpers.
4) Step 4: Objective — if the patch adds bounds/length checks, detect unsafe indexing/copying pre-patch. Signals — array/vector/string indexing or memory copy/format operations using tainted or unchecked lengths; patch-added comparison reveals the intended constraint. FP mitigation — require the same index/length operand and verify a dominating comparison is missing.
5) Step 5: Objective — if the patch adds ownership/lifetime management (free/close/unref) or lock usage, detect misuse. Signals — resource acquisition without corresponding release, double-free, or access outside lock region; patch adds release or lock/unlock around region. FP mitigation — verify the same resource variable and control-flow region; exclude cases where lifetime is transferred.
6) Step 6: Objective — if the patch adds permission/capability checks, detect privileged operations performed without guard. Signals — calls to sensitive APIs with no prior permission/role/capability check nodes matching those added in patch. FP mitigation — recognize equivalent guard helpers and framework-level annotations as valid checks.
7) Step 7: Objective — identify dataflow relationships implied by the patch (e.g., parameter-to-sink validation). Signals — track flow from specific parameters/fields to the sink call or dereference that gained a guard; pre-patch sites using the same flow without the guard are flagged. FP mitigation — require that no intervening sanitizer/validator equivalent to the patch is present.
8) Step 8: Objective — detect incorrect error handling corrected by the patch (e.g., ignored error codes). Signals — function whose return is now compared to error sentinel and handled; pre-patch sites that ignore or invert this condition. FP mitigation — ensure the same sentinel/error semantics and consistent comparator usage as in the patch.
9) Step 9: Objective — capture API misuse corrected by the patch (e.g., wrong order of calls). Signals — sequences of API calls reordered in the patch; find occurrences of the old sequence. FP mitigation — require adjacency or tight control-flow proximity and same receiver object.
10) Step 10: Objective — scope the checker to modified modules/namespaces from the patch. Signals — file paths, namespaces, classes touched by the patch define the scanning scope. FP mitigation — avoid applying to unrelated modules to reduce noise.
11) Step 11: Objective — validate dominance of the guard relative to the sink. Signals — ensure the added check dominates all paths to the sensitive operation in patched code; pre-patch sites lacking a dominating guard are violations. FP mitigation — allow equivalently dominating checks via inlined helper calls.
12) Step 12: Objective — confirm the sink’s safety aspects (null-deref, OOB, race, permission, etc.) by the patch’s guard semantics. Signals — match the guard’s predicate with the sink’s risk (e.g., null check before deref, length check before copy). FP mitigation — exclude cases where the sink is intrinsically safe (documented safe wrappers).

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch, and their call sites.
- Conditional checks introduced in the patch (if-statements, assertions, early returns).
- Function return-value uses and error-handling branches.
- Resource acquisition/release sites and lock/unlock regions.
- Memory and string operations (copy/format/index) affected by new checks.
- Privileged/sensitive API call sites.
- API call sequences re-ordered by the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from function parameters and external inputs to sensitive sinks indicated by the patch.
- Model validators/sanitizers that correspond to guards added by the patch (null/bounds/permission checks).
- Track ownership/locking state across control-flow to detect lifetime or race-condition fixes added by the patch.
- Track error-code propagation and usage to detect newly introduced error-handling patterns.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippets that replicate the missing guard, unchecked return, unsafe length usage, missing lock/release, or wrong call order precisely as indicated by the patch once available.
- Negative: Post-patch snippets demonstrating the newly added guard/handling; variants with equivalent validation via helper functions; safe wrappers around sinks.
- Test harness notes: Run on both pre- and post-patch versions to confirm violations appear only pre-patch and disappear post-patch; include path-sensitivity checks to ensure dominance of guards.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires concretizing signals from the missing patch/root cause before implementing precise patterns.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent validation in helper functions not directly matched — mitigate by modeling known validator helpers once identified from the patch.
- Contextually safe sinks (e.g., wrapper APIs) — mitigate by excluding safe wrappers documented or inferred from the patch.
- Divergent control-flow that provides implicit guarantees — mitigate with dominance and path-sensitivity requirements aligning with the patch’s placement of checks.
- API variants with different semantics — constrain to the exact functions/receivers and modules shown in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS, PATCH_DESCRIPTION, PATCH_DIFF, or FILE_CONTENT content was provided; therefore, the vulnerability class, affected APIs, and precise guard semantics are unknown.
- The steps above are a generic template that must be parameterized by concrete signals extracted from the actual patch/fix once available.
- Assumes the patch introduces explicit, statically detectable changes (guards, orderings, resource handling) rather than purely configuration/runtime fixes.
