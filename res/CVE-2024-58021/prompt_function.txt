1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58021

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference due to unchecked allocation result

3. Root Cause Summary
In drivers/hid/hid-winwing.c, function winwing_init_led(), the driver assigns led->cdev.name using devm_kasprintf() but does not check for a NULL return on allocation failure. The subsequent call to devm_led_classdev_register(&hdev->dev, &led->cdev) proceeds with led->cdev.name potentially NULL, allowing the LED core to dereference a NULL pointer. This omission was introduced in the WinWing Orion2 throttle support (Fixes: 266c990debad) and can lead to a kernel crash when memory allocation fails.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
HID driver (drivers/hid/hid-winwing.c) interacting with the LED class device subsystem.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
winwing_init_led() sets cdev.name with devm_kasprintf(...) and immediately calls devm_led_classdev_register() without validating that cdev.name is non-NULL. Pre-patch code: led->cdev.name = devm_kasprintf(...); ret = devm_led_classdev_register(...);

3) Trigger Condition:
devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s::%s", ...) returns NULL (e.g., under memory pressure or allocation failure) while initializing any of the three LEDs in the for-loop.

4) Impact Mechanism:
devm_led_classdev_register() (and downstream LED core paths) expect cdev.name to be a valid string; a NULL name leads to a NULL pointer dereference in kernel space, causing an OOPS/panic and denial of service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce a defensive NULL check after devm_kasprintf() and return -ENOMEM on failure, preventing registration with an invalid cdev.name.

2) Key Code Changes:
In winwing_init_led(), immediately after setting led->cdev.name:
+ if (!led->cdev.name)
+     return -ENOMEM;
This ensures the subsequent devm_led_classdev_register() is only called with a valid name.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is limited to error handling during device initialization; no locks or ordering were added or modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Unchecked allocation results in initialization paths are a common source of kernel NULL dereferences and system instability. Ensuring all devm_* and *_kasprintf() returns are validated before use strengthens robustness against low-memory conditions and reduces denial-of-service risks across drivers. This fix exemplifies necessary defensive checks when interfacing with core subsystems (LED classdev) that assume non-NULL fields.
