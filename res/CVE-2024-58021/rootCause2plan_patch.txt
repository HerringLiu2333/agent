1. Plan Summary
Detect unchecked devm_kasprintf return values that flow into struct fields (e.g., led->cdev.name) and are used in subsequent operations (notably devm_led_classdev_register) without a dominating NULL check, which can cause a NULL pointer dereference.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Identify allocation calls to devm_kasprintf whose return value is assigned to a pointer-typed variable or struct field. Signals: a call to devm_kasprintf on the RHS of an assignment; LHS is a pointer (e.g., led->cdev.name). FP mitigation: restrict to C/C++ kernel code and pointer-typed LHS only.

2) Step 2: For each such assignment, record the specific lvalue target (variable or field path), including nested fields (e.g., led->cdev.name). Signals: member access chain on the LHS. FP mitigation: preserve the exact field path to avoid mixing with aliases.

3) Step 3: Find subsequent uses of that lvalue (or the struct containing it) that imply it is consumed by a kernel API likely to dereference it, with a focus on devm_led_classdev_register. Signals: a later call passing the address of the struct containing the field (e.g., &led->cdev) to devm_led_classdev_register. FP mitigation: require the field path includes a terminal “name” field per [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

4) Step 4: Additionally, capture direct dereferences or string-use patterns on the allocated pointer (if present) after the assignment. Signals: pointer dereference, passing the pointer to functions that normally read strings. FP mitigation: prioritize matches where the uses are in the same function as the allocation, as in winwing_init_led() (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).

5) Step 5: Perform path-sensitive control-flow analysis from the assignment to each identified use to ensure there is no dominating NULL check on the same lvalue. Signals: a conditional like if (!led->cdev.name) that leads to an error-handling path. FP mitigation: require the check to lead to an early exit (e.g., return -ENOMEM) before the use (based on [PATCH_DIFF]).

6) Step 6: If the pointer is reassigned before use, re-start the analysis at the most recent assignment and recompute checks. Signals: any write to the same lvalue path between allocation and use. FP mitigation: only flag when there is no later write that could guarantee non-NULL.

7) Step 7: Exclude cases where a NULL check is present on an equivalent alias of the same pointer value that dominates the use. Signals: checks on the same memory location or pointer alias that flows into the field. FP mitigation: require proven equivalence via dataflow to the lvalue under test.

8) Step 8: Report a finding when there exists a path from devm_kasprintf assignment to a consuming use (e.g., devm_led_classdev_register) with no dominating NULL check on the assigned lvalue. Rationale: This matches the root cause where devm_kasprintf can return NULL and the code proceeds to register the device, causing a NULL dereference (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).

3. Target Elements
- Function bodies where devm_kasprintf is called.
- Call sites of devm_kasprintf and devm_led_classdev_register.
- Assignments to pointer-typed variables and struct fields (e.g., led->cdev.name).
- Condition checks comparing a pointer to NULL (e.g., if (!ptr)).
- Early-exit statements (return of error codes) following such checks.
- Uses of the pointer or of structs containing it after assignment.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the value returned by devm_kasprintf to its assignment target (including nested fields).
- Propagate through the assigned field into subsequent calls where the containing struct is passed (e.g., &led->cdev to devm_led_classdev_register).
- Determine absence of a dominating NULL-check along all paths from assignment to use.
- Treat reassignments as sinks that reset the tracked value; handle aliases to avoid missing checks on equivalent pointers.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Function assigns led->cdev.name = devm_kasprintf(...); no NULL check; then calls devm_led_classdev_register(&hdev->dev, &led->cdev). Expect a finding (matches [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Positive: The assigned pointer is later dereferenced or passed to a known string-consuming function without a prior NULL check. Expect a finding.
- Negative: Same as positive, but with an immediate if (!led->cdev.name) return -ENOMEM; before the register call. Expect no finding (matches [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Negative: devm_kasprintf result is assigned but never used in any call or dereference. Expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Run within a Linux kernel codebase slice to ensure function and struct field resolution; verify path-sensitivity by introducing alternate branches with checks.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium effort; high priority for kernel drivers due to crash potential and alignment with [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- NULL checks performed via macros or helper functions not recognized: mitigate by modeling common patterns (if (!ptr)) and early returns.
- Checks inside callee functions (e.g., devm_led_classdev_register guarding NULL): cannot see into kernel internals; mitigate by scoping to known risky API as per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Complex aliasing where the pointer is validated indirectly: mitigate by conservative alias tracking and requiring dominance of a check on the same memory location.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes devm_kasprintf may return NULL and that using the result in devm_led_classdev_register without checks is unsafe (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); other devm_* allocations are mentioned broadly but not enumerated.
- Does not validate actual callee behavior; treats devm_led_classdev_register as potentially dereferencing the name field based on [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].
- Interprocedural validations beyond the current function are out of scope.
