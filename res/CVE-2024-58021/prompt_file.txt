1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58021

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference leading to kernel crash (denial of service) due to missing allocation failure handling.

3. Root Cause Summary
winwing_init_led() assigned led->cdev.name using devm_kasprintf() without checking for a NULL return on allocation failure. The code immediately proceeded to devm_led_classdev_register(&hdev->dev, &led->cdev), which relies on cdev.name and could dereference it unconditionally. Under low-memory conditions, devm_kasprintf() returns NULL, causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference during LED class device registration.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
HID driver for WinWing Orion 2 throttle (drivers/hid/hid-winwing.c), interacting with the LED subsystem.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In winwing_init_led(), the line “led->cdev.name = devm_kasprintf(...);” was not followed by a NULL check, leaving led->cdev.name potentially NULL when passed to devm_led_classdev_register().

3) Trigger Condition:
Memory allocation failure in devm_kasprintf(&hdev->dev, GFP_KERNEL, "%s::%s", dev_name(&input->dev), info->led_name) while initializing any of the three LEDs during HID input configuration.

4) Impact Mechanism:
A NULL led->cdev.name propagates into devm_led_classdev_register() or subsequent LED core usage, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and kernel oops/panic, resulting in denial of service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Add defensive checking for the devm_kasprintf() return value and abort LED initialization with an error when led->cdev.name is NULL.

2) Key Code Changes:
Inserted:
“if (!led->cdev.name)
    return -ENOMEM;”
immediately after the devm_kasprintf() assignment in winwing_init_led().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch introduces no locking changes; it only adds an early error return to avoid unsafe use of a NULL pointer.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Unchecked allocation results are a common source of kernel crashes in device drivers, especially in initialization paths where subsequent framework registration assumes valid pointers. Ensuring all devm_* allocations (including devm_kasprintf) are validated prevents plug-in-time crashes under memory pressure and improves robustness of HID/LED integration. This fix exemplifies the need for systematic audits of error handling in driver init code to avoid denial-of-service conditions.
