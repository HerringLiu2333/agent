1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence provided to identify the exact vulnerability class; propose a patch-differential detection strategy that generalizes the pre-patch flaw from the safeguards introduced by the patch.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Determine the functions, methods, or files modified by the patch — signals: names and locations of edited routines and any newly added guards (conditionals, precondition checks, sanitizers) that the patch introduces.
2) Step 2: Infer the protective condition(s) added by the patch — signals: newly added boolean checks (e.g., null/length/bounds/auth/permission/state validation) immediately preceding sensitive operations or early returns on failed validation.
3) Step 3: Identify the sensitive operation(s) that are directly impacted by the new checks — signals: specific calls, dereferences, array/index use, resource access, or state transitions placed under the newly added guard.
4) Step 4: Model the dependency between the guard and the sensitive operation — signals: control-flow edges that ensure the operation occurs only if the guard predicate holds true after the patch.
5) Step 5: Locate pre-patch or unguarded contexts of the same sensitive operation — signals: paths where the same operation is reachable without the inferred guard condition or where equivalent checks are missing or incomplete.
6) Step 6: If applicable, infer input/sources implied by the guard (e.g., parameters or external data that the check validates) — signals: dataflow from function parameters, configuration, environment, network, or user inputs flowing into the sensitive operation without the guard.
7) Step 7: Report instances where the sensitive operation is reachable without the protective condition — signals: control-flow path to the operation lacking the guard, or a weaker condition that does not enforce the same predicate introduced by the patch.
8) Step 8: Highlight contextual factors that match the patch’s intent — signals: same API usage patterns, same call sites, same file/namespace/module, and similar data types that appeared in the patch, to reduce false positives.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] content was provided; therefore the precise vulnerability class, guard predicate, sources, and sensitive operations cannot be enumerated.
- The plan assumes a patch introduces explicit guard(s) around a sensitive operation; if the patch refactors or changes semantics without guards, additional evidence is required.
- Source categories (e.g., user input, network) and API specifics must be derived from the actual patch/files; without them, the checker cannot be concretely parameterized.
