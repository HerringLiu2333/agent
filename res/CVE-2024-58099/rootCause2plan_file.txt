1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence to define a vulnerability-specific detector; below is a structured, patch-differencing-driven plan template that must be instantiated once the root cause and patch details are known.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — derive the semantic condition(s) the patch introduced (e.g., a precondition, validation, synchronization, lifetime, or error handling contract). Signals — compare pre-/post-patch code to extract the newly enforced condition(s) or sequencing. FP mitigation — none possible without [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; this is a preparatory step.

2) Step 2: Objective — identify the protected sinks or operations that the new condition guards. Signals — locate the code elements immediately affected by the added checks or refactor (e.g., the callee(s) now guarded, state mutations now gated, or memory access now bounded). FP mitigation — restrict to exactly the elements referenced by the patch to avoid over-generalizing.

3) Step 3: Objective — generalize the guard condition into a checkable predicate. Signals — model the guard as a boolean predicate over program state, input, permissions, indices, or object lifetime implied by the patch. FP mitigation — keep the predicate minimal (only what the patch enforces) to avoid including unrelated safety checks.

4) Step 4: Objective — find pre-patch code paths where the sink is reachable without satisfying the predicate. Signals — path search from sources to the sink with absence of the predicate along the path (missing check, missing lock, missing refcount, missing error handling), as revealed by the patch. FP mitigation — require path feasibility (no contradicting conditions) and same contextual scope/module as in the patch to reduce noise.

5) Step 5: Objective — account for equivalent alternative protections. Signals — recognize logically equivalent guards: earlier checks, wrapper functions enforcing the predicate, or API variants that embed the condition. FP mitigation — whitelist patterns that implement the same guarantee (e.g., helper that validates and forwards) to avoid flagging safe uses.

6) Step 6: Objective — capture interprocedural propagation of the predicate. Signals — if the patch moved checks into a callee or out to a caller, propagate the requirement across call boundaries accordingly. FP mitigation — limit propagation depth to the call chain segments touched by the patch to prevent unrelated flows.

7) Step 7: Objective — model stateful preconditions if the patch sets/reads state flags. Signals — identify state variables/flags whose values are set before the sink and must satisfy a relation at use time. FP mitigation — require dominance or proven ordering between state write and sink to avoid speculative matches.

8) Step 8: Objective — handle resource/lifetime contracts if the patch adds allocation/free or refcount operations. Signals — enforce that acquisition precedes use and balanced release occurs, as mandated by the patch. FP mitigation — exclude paths that demonstrably acquire via alternative APIs recognized as equivalent.

9) Step 9: Objective — handle concurrency ordering if the patch adds locks/atomics. Signals — require the presence of the same lock or happens-before edge around the sink, per the patch’s insertion points. FP mitigation — recognize established lock hierarchies or RAII wrappers providing the same protection.

10) Step 10: Objective — handle error/return-value checking if the patch adds result validation. Signals — require that error-prone returns are checked and lead to safe control flow before the sink executes. FP mitigation — exclude cases where API guarantees non-error returns (documented prevalidated inputs or wrappers).

11) Step 11: Objective — restrict scope to files/functions changed by the patch and their immediate callers/callees. Signals — map analysis to the impacted components to avoid organization-wide false positives. FP mitigation — only escalate to broader search after confirming specific instances in the impacted area.

12) Step 12: Objective — rank findings by patch-consistency. Signals — prioritize paths most structurally similar to the pre-patch pattern fixed by the patch (same callee names, same argument shapes, same control structure). FP mitigation — de-prioritize low-similarity matches to reduce triage burden.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified by the patch and their immediate callers/callees.
- Call sites to the sink operations guarded by the patch.
- Condition checks added by the patch and their surrounding control-flow constructs.
- Resource acquisition/release sites, lifetime/references if the patch affects them.
- Locking/atomic sections if the patch introduces concurrency controls.
- Function return-value checks if the patch adds error handling.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track path feasibility from entry to sink requiring the absence of the patched guard predicate.
- Propagate guard satisfaction across calls when wrappers or helper functions enforce it.
- Model state flags or capability tokens set prior to sink and required at use time.
- Enforce ordering constraints for resources (acquire-before-use, lock-before-use) as indicated by the patch.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A minimal pre-patch snippet where the sink operation is executed without the newly added guard/condition; the checker should report it.
- Negative: The same snippet updated to include the exact guard/ordering/error-check added by the patch; the checker should not report.
- Test harness notes: Construct tests within the same API surface and control structure as the patch to ensure the predicate and sink mapping is accurate.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — once [PATCH_DIFF] or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available, translating the patch-enforced predicate into a detector is straightforward; without them, it cannot be instantiated.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent guards implemented via different helpers or frameworks — mitigate by recognizing wrapper/RAII patterns.
- Infeasible paths where the missing check is dominated elsewhere — mitigate with path feasibility and dominance analysis.
- Contexts where API-level guarantees obviate the check — mitigate by modeling such guarantees as preconditions.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the vulnerability class and concrete signals are unknown.
- All steps are methodological placeholders; the concrete predicate, sink(s), and scope must be instantiated once patch/root-cause details are available.
- Assumes the fix introduces an explicit semantic guard/ordering that can be recognized statically; if the fix is purely architectural or configuration-based, this approach may not apply.
