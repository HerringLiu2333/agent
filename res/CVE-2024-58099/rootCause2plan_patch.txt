1. Plan Summary
Meta-detection framework to infer the fix pattern from the patch and root-cause analysis, then flag analogous sites missing the same safety predicate or guard elsewhere in the codebase.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — inventory the concrete changes that constitute the fix; Conceptual signals — functions/files touched in [PATCH_DIFF], added/removed conditionals, early returns, helper calls, or resource/lock operations; FP mitigation — ignore pure refactors (renames/reformat) and unchanged semantics. (Note: No patch content provided; this step depends on [PATCH_DIFF].)

2) Step 2: Objective — classify the defensive construct(s) added by the fix; Signals — presence of new null/range/bounds/overflow/permission/return-value checks, added lock/unlock or guard wrappers, added size clamping or type conversions; FP mitigation — require that the added construct directly guards a hazardous use (dereference/index/memcpy/state update). (Root cause details are missing in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].)

3) Step 3: Objective — extract the precondition predicate template introduced by the fix; Signals — variables referenced in the new guard and the sink they dominate (e.g., pointer use, array access, API call), including helper sanitizers added; FP mitigation — require semantic alignment (same variables/types/sink family) rather than superficial syntax matches.

4) Step 4: Objective — discover analogous sinks across the codebase where the same predicate should apply; Signals — other occurrences of the same operation or API with operands/data roles matching those in the patched site (parameters, returns, fields); FP mitigation — constrain search to the same subsystem/module or function family touched by the patch.

5) Step 5: Objective — check for absence of an equivalent guard at candidate sinks; Signals — lack of dominating condition equivalent to the predicate template or absence of the newly introduced sanitizer/helper before sink use; FP mitigation — treat equivalent checks in inlined helpers/macros as present and account for negations/early-return idioms.

6) Step 6: Objective — ensure dataflow congruence between the patched site and candidates; Signals — interprocedural flow from analogous sources (params, I/O, returns) to sink operands without intervening sanitization equivalent to the predicate; FP mitigation — cease tracking at sanitizers that implement the template and ignore compile-time constants.

7) Step 7: Objective — handle fixes involving concurrency control; Signals — if patch adds a lock/guard, identify reads/writes of the same shared resources outside lock regions or without the same guard; FP mitigation — require thread-shared reachability and exclude contexts proven single-threaded.

8) Step 8: Objective — handle fixes adding return-value/error checks; Signals — call sites of the same function where the return is used without error-path branching consistent with the patch (e.g., missing null/negative/errno check before use); FP mitigation — accept alternative but equivalent error-propagation patterns and contracts that guarantee success.

9) Step 9: Objective — handle fixes adding bounds/overflow checks; Signals — arithmetic feeding sizes/indices or memory operations lacking range/overflow checks analogous to the patch, including risky type casts or multiplications; FP mitigation — require a feasible path where values can exceed limits given type ranges and inputs.

10) Step 10: Objective — handle fixes adding permission/capability/authorization checks; Signals — operations on sensitive resources now guarded by capability/ACL checks in the patch, and other sites performing the same operations without such checks; FP mitigation — constrain to the same resource types and operational context.

11) Step 11: Objective — prioritize and report likely-vulnerable instances; Signals — exact matches to sink and missing guard templates ranked highest, near-matches lower; FP mitigation — downrank findings where stronger but different guards are present or where invariants make the path unreachable.

12) Step 12: Objective — cross-validate against post-patch code; Signals — ensure that the patched sites would not be flagged by the checker, confirming template fidelity; FP mitigation — adjust template extraction if patched sites would still trigger.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified in the patch and their callers/callees.
- Condition checks (if/guard clauses), early returns, and helper sanitizer calls.
- Call sites to APIs whose return values are newly checked in the patch.
- Dangerous operations: pointer dereferences, array indexing, arithmetic used for sizes/indices, memory copies/allocations.
- Concurrency primitives: lock/unlock, guard objects, and regions of protected access.
- Accesses to shared state/resources guarded by newly added checks.
- Type conversions introduced to prevent overflow/sign issues.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from analogous sources (function parameters, external input, return values) to sink operands identified in the patched site.
- Consider a sanitizer as neutralizing flow if it implements the same predicate template (e.g., bounds check, null check, capability check).
- Require dominance/path-sensitivity: the guard must control all paths to the sink in safe cases; absence indicates risk.
- Interprocedural tracking limited to the function family touched by the patch and direct callers/callees.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch-like snippet replicating the patched sink without the newly added guard (e.g., use of a pointer/index/state without the corresponding check), which should be flagged.
- Negative: Post-patch-like snippet with the exact guard or sanitizer helper introduced by the fix dominating the sink, which should not be flagged.
- Test harness notes: Include variants with the guard in a helper/macro, with negated conditions and early returns, and with alternative but equivalent guards to test FP mitigation.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — Template extraction and equivalence checking are moderate effort, but absence of concrete patch/root cause necessitates an adaptable, pattern-driven implementation.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent guards implemented via different helper functions or macros; mitigate by recognizing helper aliases and macro expansions.
- Contextual invariants guaranteeing safety (e.g., validated earlier in the call chain); mitigate with interprocedural dominance checks and sanitizer recognition.
- Dead or unreachable code; mitigate with basic path-feasibility screening.
- Single-threaded contexts when analyzing concurrency fixes; mitigate by requiring evidence of multi-threaded reachability.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are unavailable, so the vulnerability class and exact predicates are unknown; the plan relies on deriving templates from those sources.
- Assumes the patch introduces explicit defensive constructs (checks/locks/sanitizers) that can be extracted as templates; if the fix is purely algorithmic or restructures control flow without clear guards, detection will be less precise.
- Cannot specify concrete APIs, predicates, or resources without the missing materials, so results depend on future patch-based template instantiation.
