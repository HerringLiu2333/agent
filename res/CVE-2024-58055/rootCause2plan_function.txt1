1. Plan Summary
Detect XDP transmit paths where the DMA address is computed from the page base plus a fixed headroom constant rather than using a dynamic offset from the current xdp buffer data pointer, leading to corrupted TX packets.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Locate functions handling XDP buffers and TX DMA setup; signals include references to xdpf->data (or xdp->data), xdpf->len, and calls to dma_sync_single_for_device with DMA_TO_DEVICE.
2) Step 2: Within those functions, find computations of a DMA address based on page_pool_get_dma_addr(...) where the page argument is derived from virt_to_page(xdpf->data) or equivalent.
3) Step 3: Identify assignments of the computed DMA address to a TX descriptor field (e.g., tbi->dma_addr) that add a fixed constant/macro offset (e.g., VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM) to the page_pool_get_dma_addr(...) result.
4) Step 4: Confirm that the same computed DMA address is subsequently passed to dma_sync_single_for_device and the size argument corresponds to the XDP frame length (e.g., xdpf->len or a buf_size derived from it).
5) Step 5: Check whether the offset term is static (literal or macro) and does not depend on the current data pointer; signals include no use of expressions like (xdpf->data - xdpf->data_hard_start) or equivalents in the addition.
6) Step 6: Verify contextual TX intent; signals include storing the address in a transmit buffer/descriptor field and DMA_TO_DEVICE direction, indicating NIC TX mapping.
7) Step 7: Exclude safe implementations by detecting any dynamic offset calculation from the xdp buffer (e.g., addition of xdpf->data - xdpf->data_hard_start); if present in the DMA address computation, do not flag.
8) Step 8: Elevate priority for findings within vmxnet3 driver code paths or when the constant offset is VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM, as explicitly cited in the root cause and patch description.
9) Step 9: Reduce false positives by requiring the trio of signals: use of xdpf->data to derive the page, fixed-offset addition to page_pool_get_dma_addr(...), and subsequent dma_sync_single_for_device using that address and XDP length.
10) Step 10: Emit a result when all signals align, describing the exact expression that adds a fixed headroom to the DMA base without a dynamic xdp->data-based offset, and pointing to the TX DMA sync usage.

3. Limitations & Assumptions
- The plan assumes code exposes XDP buffer fields (data, data_hard_start, len); if drivers abstract these, detection may miss cases.
- It assumes availability of symbol names like VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM and functions like page_pool_get_dma_addr, virt_to_page, and dma_sync_single_for_device as signals.
- Call-chain context (e.g., vmxnet3_run_xdp/vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back) is not used; the checker relies on local patterns, which may not capture all transmit paths.
