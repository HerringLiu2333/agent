1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38350

2. Vulnerability Type
Use-after-free due to incorrect lifetime/state handling (missing/incorrect parent notification when child qdisc becomes empty)

3. Root Cause Summary
qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog suppressed parent notification unless certain backlog parameters were non-zero or the qdisc was offloaded. Specifically, it had an early return when n==0 && len==0 and computed notify using “notify = !sch->q.qlen && !WARN_ON_ONCE(!n && !qdisc_is_offloaded)”. When a child qdisc became empty outside of those accounting paths (e.g., during deletion/reset or via dequeue-on-enqueue behavior), the parent was not notified, leaving stale active class state that could later be reactivated and dereference freed child structures, causing a use-after-free.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Networking traffic control (net/sched), classful qdiscs; function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- The function returned early if (n == 0 && len == 0), skipping parent traversal and notification entirely.
- Notification was gated by backlog/offload checks: “notify = !sch->q.qlen && !WARN_ON_ONCE(!n && !qdisc_is_offloaded)”, meaning emptiness without accompanying n/len updates would suppress qlen_notify().
- This relied on backlog accounting being aligned with actual queue emptiness, which is not guaranteed when classes dequeue on enqueue or during reset/purge paths.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Child qdisc becomes empty without corresponding n/len reductions, such as:
  - qdisc deletion/reset/purge (qdisc_reset()/qdisc_purge_queue() set qlen to 0),
  - classful qdisc invoking a class’s dequeue during enqueue (empties child unexpectedly).
- Example from reproducer: delete a class under DRR/HFSC stack and then send another packet, which runs qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog without n/len updates but with qlen==0.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Parent is not notified via cops->qlen_notify when the child becomes empty, so parent’s class may remain or be reactivated with stale pointers to the freed child.
- Subsequent scheduling or reactivation dereferences freed class/qdisc memory, resulting in a use-after-free.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Always notify the parent when the child qdisc is empty, independent of backlog counters or offload status, ensuring parent class state is updated/neutralized whenever qlen hits zero. This relies on idempotent qlen_notify handlers to safely handle multiple notifications.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Removed early return: “if (n == 0 && len == 0) return;”
- Removed offload gating and WARN_ON logic; simplified notification condition to “notify = !sch->q.qlen”.
- Eliminated qdisc_is_offloaded variable and special-casing.
- Added comment clarifying qlen_notify must be idempotent; left RCU traversal intact and unchanged.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- RCU read-side locking remains as before; no changes to lock/unlock points or ordering.
- The change narrows the race window by ensuring state convergence (notification) whenever qlen==0; multiple notifications are now safe due to idempotent qlen_notify, reducing lifetime mismatches that previously led to UAF.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
By making parent notification unconditional on child emptiness, the patch hardens classful qdisc teardown and unusual dequeue-on-enqueue paths against stale state and lifetime mismatches, a recurring source of UAFs in net/sched. It removes fragile dependence on backlog counters and offload-specific behavior, promoting consistent parent-child state updates. With idempotent qlen_notify across classful qdiscs, duplicate notifications no longer pose a risk, improving robustness against complex qdisc stacks and reducing opportunities for memory safety violations.
