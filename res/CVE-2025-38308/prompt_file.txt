1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38308

2. Vulnerability Type
Null pointer dereference leading to denial of service

3. Root Cause Summary
The function avs_hw_constraints_init() re-searched for a path template using avs_dai_find_path_template() and passed the result directly to avs_path_set_constraint() without checking for NULL. If the search returned NULL, the subsequent use in constraint setup could dereference a NULL pointer. The correct template had already been obtained and validated earlier in avs_dai_startup() and stored in data->template, but avs_hw_constraints_init() ignored this and performed an unvalidated redundant lookup.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
ALSA System on Chip (ASoC) Intel AVS driver (sound/soc/intel/avs)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- In avs_hw_constraints_init(), the code did:
  “template = avs_dai_find_path_template(dai, !rtd->dai_link->no_pcm, substream->stream);
   ret = avs_path_set_constraint(data->adev, template, r, c, s);”
- The returned template pointer was not validated for NULL before use.
- This is redundant because avs_dai_startup() had already found and validated the template (“if (!template) return -EINVAL;”) and stored it in data->template.

3) Trigger Condition:
- During DAI startup when avs_hw_constraints_init() runs, if avs_dai_find_path_template() unexpectedly returns NULL (e.g., due to missing/invalid DAPM path edges for the given FE/BE and direction), the function would still call avs_path_set_constraint() with a NULL template.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Passing a NULL template into avs_path_set_constraint() leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing template fields during constraint computation, resulting in a kernel oops and possible system crash during audio stream initialization.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Eliminate the redundant and unverified template lookup in avs_hw_constraints_init().
- Use the already validated template stored in avs_dma_data (data->template) by avs_dai_startup().

2) Key Code Changes:
- Removed local variables rtd and template from avs_hw_constraints_init().
- Deleted the call to avs_dai_find_path_template().
- Changed “ret = avs_path_set_constraint(data->adev, template, r, c, s);” to “ret = avs_path_set_constraint(data->adev, data->template, r, c, s);”.
- This relies on the earlier validation in avs_dai_startup(): “template = avs_dai_find_path_template(...); if (!template) return -EINVAL; data->template = template;”.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- No locking changes. The patch only adjusts data flow to use a validated pointer; no impact on synchronization, ordering, or RCU.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Centralizing and reusing validated object pointers avoids redundant lookups and eliminates unchecked NULL returns, reducing crash surfaces in driver initialization logic. This change reinforces the pattern of validating and storing critical topology-derived resources once and using them consistently, which benefits robustness of audio subsystem operations and reduces potential local denial-of-service vectors during device bring-up or stream setup.
