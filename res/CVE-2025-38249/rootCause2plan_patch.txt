1. Plan Summary
Detect cases where a device-controlled length is used to allocate a buffer that is then cast to a struct and dereferenced without first verifying the length is at least the sizeof that struct, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads (as in CVE-2025-38249).

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify device-controlled length sources. Signals — Variables assigned from return values of device I/O helpers (e.g., snd_usb_ctl_msg) or from descriptor fields like hc_header.wLength, possibly wrapped in le16_to_cpu; based on PATCH_DESCRIPTION and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS. FP mitigation — Prefer fields literally named wLength and flows passing through le16_to_cpu, and API calls in USB/ALSA contexts (function/file names containing usb, uac, audio).

2) Step 2: Objective — Propagate the length through simple transformations. Signals — Direct assignments, integer casts, and simple arithmetic (e.g., copying to wLength, using temporary variables). FP mitigation — Limit to intra-procedural or bounded inter-procedural flow to avoid over-tainting.

3) Step 3: Objective — Find allocations sized by the (tainted) length. Signals — Calls to kzalloc/kmalloc/vmalloc/krealloc where the allocation size argument is the tainted length or a linear expression of it; mapped from PATCH_DIFF showing kzalloc(wLength). FP mitigation — Require the tainted component to dominate the size expression (e.g., not multiplied by zero, not min-clamped to a safe bound).

4) Step 4: Objective — Detect that the allocated buffer is treated as a specific struct instance. Signals — Cast/assignment of the allocated pointer to a pointer-to-struct type, or equivalent via container_of, followed by at least one field access (p->field) on that typed pointer; per PATCH_DESCRIPTION that the buffer is cast to uac3_cluster_header_descriptor and fields accessed. FP mitigation — Require an actual field dereference (not just passing the pointer) on a path post-allocation.

5) Step 5: Objective — Locate unguarded struct field accesses that could assume a minimum size. Signals — Field dereferences on the cast pointer occurring after the allocation and before any resizing, copy, or reallocation. FP mitigation — Ensure the dereference is control-flow reachable from the allocation without intervening size validation that dominates it.

6) Step 6: Objective — Check for required minimum-size validation. Signals — Look for dominating conditions comparing the tainted length against sizeof(*ptr) or sizeof(struct-type) with an early exit (return/goto/error) when length is too small; aligns with PATCH_DIFF adding “if (wLength < sizeof(*cluster)) return”. FP mitigation — Recognize equivalent guards (>=, <= inversions) and common idioms that enforce the same constraint.

7) Step 7: Objective — Exclude cases where the length is clamped to a safe minimum before use. Signals — Assignments like len = max(len, sizeof(struct-type)) or size expressions using max_t/clamp to ensure size >= sizeof(struct-type) prior to allocation or deref. FP mitigation — Require the clamp to dominate both allocation and deref on all paths.

8) Step 8: Objective — Confirm that the length is externally controlled (not a trusted constant). Signals — Evidence that the length originates from device-provided data (descriptor fields such as wLength or return of snd_usb_ctl_msg) as per PATCH_DESCRIPTION and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS. FP mitigation — Downgrade or suppress findings when the length is computed solely from constants or trusted compile-time values.

9) Step 9: Objective — Report only when the full vulnerability triad is present. Signals — (a) tainted/external length → (b) allocation sized by that length → (c) cast to struct and field deref without dominating len >= sizeof(struct) check. FP mitigation — Require all three elements on a single feasible path and include a path explanation from source to deref.

3. Target Elements
- Functions that parse or handle device descriptors.
- Call sites of device I/O helpers and endianness converters (e.g., le16_to_cpu).
- Variables receiving descriptor lengths (e.g., wLength) and their assignments.
- Allocation sites (kzalloc/kmalloc/vmalloc/krealloc).
- Casts/assignments to pointer-to-struct types.
- Struct field dereferences (p->field).
- Conditional checks comparing length to sizeof(struct) or constants.
- Early-exit statements (return/goto) enforcing bounds.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Treat as taint sources: return values of device control functions (e.g., snd_usb_ctl_msg) and descriptor fields like hc_header.wLength, especially when passed through le16_to_cpu (per PATCH_DESCRIPTION and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Track taint through assignments, simple arithmetic, and integer casts to the allocation size argument.
- Propagate the allocated pointer to its casted struct-typed aliases to detect field dereferences.
- Use control-flow dominance to verify whether a len >= sizeof(struct) guard protects the dereference.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Code that sets wLength = le16_to_cpu(hc_header.wLength); allocates buffer = kzalloc(wLength, ...); casts to struct uac3_cluster_header_descriptor*; dereferences fields; no preceding check wLength >= sizeof(*buffer) — should be flagged (reflecting PATCH_DIFF pre-fix).
- Positive: Code that uses len = snd_usb_ctl_msg(...); buf = kmalloc(len, ...); hdr = (struct header*)buf; use hdr->field; no minimum-size validation — should be flagged (as per PATCH_DESCRIPTION).
- Negative: Same as above but with if (wLength < sizeof(*hdr)) return; before allocation or dereference — should not be flagged (matches PATCH_DIFF fix).
- Negative: Allocation size is max(len, sizeof(struct header)); or dereference occurs only after confirming len >= sizeof(struct header) — should not be flagged.
- Test harness notes: Validate path reasoning shows source (device-controlled length) → allocation → dereference and absence/presence of dominating guards.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium effort; high priority due to kernel memory safety impact and prevalence in descriptor parsing paths (per ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS and PATCH_DESCRIPTION).

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Cases where only a small subset of fields are accessed and guaranteed to fit even when len < sizeof(struct) — mitigate by requiring any deref without explicit size proof to be guarded by sizeof checks.
- Variable-length/flexible-array structs where sizeof(struct) includes trailing fields not strictly required — mitigate by allowing explicit protocol-specific minimum constants when present; otherwise report with lower confidence.
- Code that validates length indirectly (e.g., via separate helper) that the analysis fails to connect — mitigate by recognizing common helper patterns when feasible.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The plan assumes identification of device-controlled sources via names like wLength or snd_usb_ctl_msg; other device APIs are not enumerated in the provided materials.
- It does not model exact protocol-specific minimal sizes beyond sizeof(struct), as those constants are not provided.
- It assumes dereferencing a casted struct implies need for at least sizeof(struct) bytes; partial-field-safe patterns cannot be conclusively distinguished from the inputs.
