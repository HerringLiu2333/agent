1. Plan Summary
Diff-guided detection of pre-patch code paths that are missing the security-relevant guard(s), validations, or control-flow constraints introduced by the fix for CVE-2024-58016.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify the core semantic change(s) introduced by the fix; Signals — new or strengthened condition checks, validation functions, error handling, capability/permission assertions, locking, or bounds/length checks added in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — restrict to constructs demonstrably added/modified by the patch.
2) Step 2: Objective — Extract the guarded operation(s) (sinks) the new check protects; Signals — operations that are now control-dependent on the new condition(s) or whose inputs are validated per [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — only consider operations explicitly placed under the new guard or whose arguments are sanitized by added code.
3) Step 3: Objective — Formulate the guard predicate(s); Signals — the exact condition(s), return-value checks, null/size/range validations, privilege checks, or lock acquisitions added in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — normalize trivially equivalent boolean forms to avoid missing alternate syntactic expressions.
4) Step 4: Objective — Model the precondition-to-sink relationship; Signals — control-dependence from the guard to the sink, or data-dependence from validation to argument use as implied by [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — require that the same function(s) or code region(s) appear in the patch context to avoid overgeneralization.
5) Step 5: Objective — Search for analogous sinks lacking the guard; Signals — pre-patch or other call sites that invoke the same sink(s) or perform equivalent operations without an equivalent guard or validation; FP mitigation — treat alternative, semantically stronger guards as satisfying the requirement when logically subsuming the patched check.
6) Step 6: Objective — Handle interprocedural preconditions; Signals — guards added at callers or callee prologues in [PATCH_DIFF], with propagation of required preconditions across call boundaries; FP mitigation — only flag when no upstream function on the call chain enforces an equivalent precondition.
7) Step 7: Objective — Capture added return-value/errno checks; Signals — patterns in [PATCH_DIFF] where a function’s return value is now checked before use, or error paths added; FP mitigation — do not flag if the return value is checked via a helper or wrapper that enforces the same constraint.
8) Step 8: Objective — Capture added length/range checks for buffers or indices; Signals — comparisons against sizes/limits introduced in [PATCH_DIFF] guarding memory, array, or I/O operations; FP mitigation — treat prior bounds checks that imply the same range as satisfying the condition.
9) Step 9: Objective — Capture added synchronization/locking; Signals — lock acquisitions or atomic checks added in [PATCH_DIFF] around shared-state mutations; FP mitigation — do not flag if an equivalent lock is already held on all reaching paths.
10) Step 10: Objective — Recognize capability/permission/auth checks; Signals — new authorization calls or capability assertions in [PATCH_DIFF] gating sensitive operations; FP mitigation — accept alternate, policy-equivalent checks as adequate guards.
11) Step 11: Objective — Exclude unreachable or dead code; Signals — paths proven unreachable by prior conditions or compile-time constants; FP mitigation — use simple path-feasibility pruning (e.g., contradictory conditions) to avoid spurious reports.
12) Step 12: Objective — Rank and reduce noise; Signals — prioritize exact structural matches to the patched pattern before broader analogs; FP mitigation — require both control/data dependency alignment with [PATCH_DIFF] evidence and absence of any semantically equivalent mitigation.

3. Target Elements
- Condition checks introduced or strengthened in the patch (if/else guards, switch cases, assertions).
- Function return-value checks and error-handling blocks added by the patch.
- Call sites to sensitive functions or operations that became guarded by the patch.
- Buffer/memory/array operations, index computations, and I/O calls tied to new bounds checks.
- Capability/permission/authentication validations and feature flags added by the patch.
- Lock/unlock and atomic sections added around shared-state operations.
- Function prologues/epilogues where new validations or preconditions were added.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track validation-to-use: values sanitized by newly added checks and subsequently used in sinks; flag analogous uses lacking prior validation.
- Track control-dependence: operations now gated by a condition in [PATCH_DIFF]; flag unguarded executions of the same operations.
- Track interprocedural preconditions: if the patch moves/adds checks to callers or wrappers, propagate required preconditions along the call chain.
- Track error propagation: if the patch introduces return-value checks before using results, flag uses that proceed without verifying success.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function that invokes the same sensitive operation identified in [PATCH_DIFF] but without the newly added guard or return-value check; expected: flagged.
- Negative: The same operation executed with an equivalent or stronger guard (logically subsuming the patch’s condition) or under an established lock; expected: not flagged.
- Test harness notes: Construct minimal examples mirroring the patched pattern (before/after) and interprocedural variants (guard at caller vs callee) to verify control/data-dependence matching and equivalence recognition.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — The checker relies on mining [PATCH_DIFF] semantics and mapping guards to sinks with interprocedural control/data reasoning and logical equivalence checks.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically equivalent guards written differently; mitigation: normalize conditions and allow subsumption checks.
- Guards enforced in helper/wrapper functions; mitigation: interprocedural precondition propagation and recognition of validated wrappers.
- Alternative synchronization mechanisms; mitigation: model locksets/atomic sections and accept equivalence.
- Context-specific invariants not visible statically; mitigation: path-feasibility pruning and requirement of clear guard-to-sink dependency.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- The necessary technical details of the vulnerability and fix are missing; [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are not provided, so no vulnerability-specific signals can be enumerated.
- Assumes [PATCH_DIFF] introduces explicit guard(s) or validations that can be mined and generalized; if the fix is a deep refactor without clear guard patterns, detection may be infeasible.
- Assumes the codebase language and framework constructs are supported by CodeQL libraries for control/dataflow and call-graph analysis.
