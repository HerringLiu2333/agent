1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58067

2. Vulnerability Type
Improper error handling leading to NULL pointer dereference (kernel crash/DoS)

3. Root Cause Summary
In pxa1908_mpmu_probe(), the driver incorrectly used IS_ERR()/PTR_ERR() to check the result of devm_kzalloc(), which returns NULL on failure, not ERR_PTR(). As a result, allocation failures were not detected and the code immediately dereferenced the NULL pointer (pxa_unit->base = ...), causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference during probe. The patch corrects the check to (!pxa_unit) and returns -ENOMEM, preventing dereference on failure.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
Clock framework, Marvell PXA1908 MPMU driver (drivers/clk/mmp/clk-pxa1908-mpmu.c)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In pxa1908_mpmu_probe(), after pxa_unit = devm_kzalloc(...), the code did:
“if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
This is incorrect for devm_kzalloc(), which returns NULL on error; thus the failure path was not taken.

3) Trigger Condition:
devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*pxa_unit), GFP_KERNEL) returns NULL due to allocation failure (e.g., memory pressure) during device probe.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The code proceeds to use pxa_unit despite being NULL (e.g., “pxa_unit->base = devm_platform_ioremap_resource(pdev, 0);”), leading to a NULL pointer dereference and kernel oops/panic, resulting in denial-of-service during driver initialization.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Replace the erroneous IS_ERR()/PTR_ERR() error check with a proper NULL check and return -ENOMEM on allocation failure.

2) Key Code Changes:
- “if (IS_ERR(pxa_unit)) return PTR_ERR(pxa_unit);”
+ “if (!pxa_unit) return -ENOMEM;”
Subsequent use of IS_ERR() remains correct for devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which can return ERR_PTR().

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The change is confined to error handling in probe; no locking or concurrency semantics were modified.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Incorrect use of IS_ERR() for functions that return NULL can convert ordinary allocation failures into kernel crashes, enabling system-wide denial-of-service during driver probe or module load. This fix improves robustness of the clk subsystem and emphasizes the need for correct error-handling patterns with devm_* helpers (distinguishing NULL returns from ERR_PTR() returns).
