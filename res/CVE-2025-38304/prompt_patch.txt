1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38304

2. Vulnerability Type
NULL pointer dereference (kernel crash/denial-of-service)

3. Root Cause Summary
- The function eir_get_service_data(u8 *eir, size_t eir_len, u16 uuid, size_t *len) used the caller-provided len pointer as an internal loop increment when scanning EIR_SERVICE_DATA entries.
- The len parameter is optional and may be NULL, but the pre-patch code unconditionally dereferenced it to advance the parsing cursor (“eir += *len; eir_len -= *len;”).
- This misuse caused a NULL pointer dereference whenever len == NULL and the search needed to skip a non-matching service-data element.
- The patch decouples internal iteration state from the optional output parameter by introducing a local size_t dlen used for iteration, copying back to len only if non-NULL.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- Bluetooth core, EIR (Extended Inquiry Response) parsing utilities, specifically eir_get_service_data.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- The loop called eir_get_data(..., len) and then used “*len” to move to the next entry, assuming len was non-NULL.
- No guard existed against len == NULL in the loop’s advancement path, despite len being documented/treated as optional.

3) Trigger Condition:
- eir_get_service_data invoked with len == NULL and the EIR buffer contains at least one EIR_SERVICE_DATA element that does not match the requested uuid, causing the loop to attempt “eir += *len; eir_len -= *len”.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Dereferencing a NULL len pointer causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to an oops/panic and denial-of-service.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Separate internal iteration bookkeeping from the optional output parameter by using a local variable to hold the current element length.
- Only write to the caller’s len pointer when returning a match, and never rely on it for internal cursor advancement.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Introduced local size_t dlen; and changed the loop to call eir_get_data(..., &dlen) instead of passing the possibly-NULL len.
- On match: if (len) *len = dlen - 2; (preserves previous semantics of excluding the 2-byte UUID from the returned length).
- For iteration: replaced “eir += *len; eir_len -= *len;” with “eir += dlen; eir_len -= dlen;”.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- No locking or concurrency semantics changed; this is a pure safety/robustness fix within a parsing helper.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Highlights the risk of using optional output parameters for internal control flow; similar patterns should be audited across parsing helpers.
- Improves robustness of Bluetooth EIR parsing against malformed or unexpected inputs by avoiding NULL dereferences during iteration.
- Reinforces best practice: maintain separate local state for parsing while treating caller-provided pointers as optional outputs only.
