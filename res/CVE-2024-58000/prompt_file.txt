1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58000

2. Vulnerability Type
Speculative bounds-check bypass (Spectre v1) in array indexing

3. Root Cause Summary
io_uring’s reg-wait extended argument handling used a user-controlled offset to index into a kernel array without speculation-safe clamping. In io_get_ext_arg_reg(), the code validated offset/end bounds and alignment, but then directly computed and returned ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset. Under CPU speculative execution, the bounds check could be transiently bypassed, allowing a speculative out-of-bounds access that can leak kernel data via side channels. The missing array_index_nospec() mitigation on the user-supplied index is the root cause.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
io_uring core (io_uring/io_uring.c), registered wait arguments for GETEVENTS (ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- Function: io_get_ext_arg_reg(struct io_ring_ctx *ctx, const struct io_uring_getevents_arg __user *uarg)
- The function computed an offset from a user pointer (uintptr_t uarg), checked alignment and that offset + sizeof(struct io_uring_reg_wait) stayed within ctx->cq_wait_size, then directly returned a pointer into a kernel array: “return ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset;”.
- No speculation-safe index clamping (array_index_nospec) was applied to the user-controlled offset, leaving the code susceptible to Spectre v1 transient out-of-bounds accesses.

3) Trigger Condition:
- When io_uring_enter is called with IORING_ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG, a user can supply uarg as an offset into a pre-mapped region.
- A malicious user can train branch prediction and provide an offset close to/over the boundary; on misprediction, the CPU may transiently execute the out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic and dereference before the bounds check retires.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Transient out-of-bounds access into kernel memory adjacent to ctx->cq_wait_arg during speculation can expose sensitive data through cache side channels, enabling information disclosure despite architectural checks.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Introduce speculation-safe array index clamping using array_index_nospec() on the user-provided offset.
- Use a bound of ctx->cq_wait_size - size to ensure the index plus structure size stays within the region.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In io_get_ext_arg_reg():
  - Added: “offset = array_index_nospec(offset, ctx->cq_wait_size - size);”
  - This clamps the offset to a safe range under speculation, preventing transient out-of-bounds access.
- Rationale per patch description: prevent “reg-wait speculations” by handling “kernel array using a user given index” safely and truncating by the maximum allowed offset considering the structure size.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- No locking changes; the patch strictly adds speculative execution mitigation and does not alter synchronization or ordering.
- array_index_nospec is a mitigation primitive that does not require additional locks.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
This change aligns io_uring with kernel-wide Spectre v1 hardening practices, ensuring user-controlled indices into kernel arrays are clamped under speculation. It reduces the risk of transient kernel data exposure via side channels and highlights the need to audit similar user-indexed kernel array accesses for nospec usage, especially in high-performance subsystems like io_uring where user-controlled offsets or indices are common.
