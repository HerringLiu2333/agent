1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58000

2. Vulnerability Type
Speculative execution (Spectre v1) gadget via user-controlled array index leading to speculative out-of-bounds access and potential information disclosure.

3. Root Cause Summary
The function io_get_ext_arg_reg used a user-controlled offset to index into a kernel array (ctx->cq_wait_arg) after a bounds check, but did not apply array_index_nospec to prevent speculative bypass of that check. Under mispredicted branches, speculative execution could compute ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset beyond the intended bounds. Additionally, the effective masking limit was conceptually wrong if nospec is appliedâ€”masking must consider the structure size (sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait)), not the full region size, to keep [offset, offset + size) within bounds. The patch adds array_index_nospec(offset, ctx->cq_wait_size - size) to constrain the index during speculation and ensures the limit accounts for the structure size.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
io_uring core (io_uring/io_uring.c), registered wait arguments handling.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
io_get_ext_arg_reg performed range checks on offset/end but then directly returned ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset. The absence of array_index_nospec allowed speculative execution to use an out-of-bounds user-controlled index despite the bounds check, creating a Spectre v1 gadget.

3) Trigger Condition:
A user invokes ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG and supplies an offset into a pre-mapped fixed wait region such that offset or offset + sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait) approaches/exceeds ctx->cq_wait_size, inducing a branch misprediction and speculative OOB indexing into ctx->cq_wait_arg.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Speculative OOB access via ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset can touch unintended kernel memory, enabling side-channel leakage (e.g., cache-based) of kernel data or serving as a gadget in broader Spectre-style attacks.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce array_index_nospec to sanitize the user-controlled offset against speculative execution and compute the nospec limit as ctx->cq_wait_size - sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait), ensuring the argument span remains within bounds.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In io_get_ext_arg_reg:
  Added: offset = array_index_nospec(offset, ctx->cq_wait_size - size);
  The function continues to return ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset, but now with a nospec-masked index that accounts for the structure size.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
None. The patch does not change locking, ordering, or concurrency primitives; it solely adds nospec index masking.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Applying array_index_nospec to user-influenced array indices in kernel code reduces Spectre v1 attack surface by preventing speculative OOB accesses. Ensuring limits incorporate structure sizes avoids partial-structure overreach in speculative paths. This hardening in io_uring protects against side-channel leaks and should be mirrored in other paths that use user-controlled indices to access kernel arrays or fixed regions.
