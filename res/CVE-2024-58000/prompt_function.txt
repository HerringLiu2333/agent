1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2024-58000

2. Vulnerability Type
Speculative execution (Spectre v1) bounds-check bypass leading to kernel information disclosure via side channels

3. Root Cause Summary
io_get_ext_arg_reg() uses a user-controlled offset to index into a kernel-mapped array (ctx->cq_wait_arg) and only performs architectural bounds checks. The code lacks speculation barriers/sanitization, allowing CPUs to speculatively bypass the checks and compute ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset, enabling out-of-bounds speculative reads. Specifically, after verifying alignment and that “end <= ctx->cq_wait_size,” it directly executes “return ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset;” without array_index_nospec(), leaving it vulnerable to Spectre v1.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
io_uring (registered wait arguments and fixed wait regions handling)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
In io_get_ext_arg_reg(struct io_ring_ctx *ctx, const struct io_uring_getevents_arg __user *uarg), the user-provided pointer value is treated as a byte offset and, after simple bounds/overflow checks, used as an index into ctx->cq_wait_arg: “return ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset;” This indexing lacks array_index_nospec()-based sanitization, making it susceptible to speculation attacks.

3) Trigger Condition:
A malicious user invokes ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG and supplies a crafted uarg value (offset) while training the branch predictor to mispredict the bounds check (“end > ctx->cq_wait_size”). Under speculative execution, the CPU can compute and access ctx->cq_wait_arg + offset before the check resolves.

4) Impact Mechanism:
Speculative out-of-bounds reads from the kernel’s pre-mapped cq_wait_arg region can leak adjacent kernel memory via microarchitectural side channels (cache/timing), despite architectural checks preventing the access from becoming architecturally visible.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Introduce array_index_nospec() to sanitize the user-controlled offset against a strict maximum index, preventing speculative out-of-bounds accesses. The limit passed to array_index_nospec is reduced to “ctx->cq_wait_size - size” to reflect the maximum valid starting offset for a struct io_uring_reg_wait.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Added: “offset = array_index_nospec(offset, ctx->cq_wait_size - size);”
- This is placed after the overflow and bounds checks and before computing the return pointer, ensuring speculative safety while preserving functional behavior.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency semantics changed. The patch solely adds speculative execution mitigation and does not alter synchronization, ordering, or RCU/atomic behavior.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Hardening user-influenced indices with array_index_nospec is essential to mitigate Spectre v1-style leaks throughout the kernel, especially in interfaces like io_uring that expose high-performance, user-driven control paths. This change reduces the kernel’s side-channel attack surface by ensuring validated indices cannot be abused speculatively. It aligns io_uring with established kernel-wide speculative execution mitigations and prevents information disclosure without affecting architectural correctness or performance significantly.
