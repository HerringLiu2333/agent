1. Plan Summary
Detect loops that index arrays with a power-of-two expression derived from the loop counter (e.g., BIT(i) or 1<<i) where the loop bound is not aligned with the array’s actual size, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads as seen in nvmet_ctrl_state_show().

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Find candidate loops that iterate an integer variable used to compute a bitmask index. Signals: a for/while loop with counter i and an in-loop assignment state = BIT(i) or an equivalent left shift of 1 by i (based on FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: require that the computed state is used to index an array within the loop.

2) Step 2: Identify the array being indexed with the bitmask-derived value. Signals: an expression of the form arr[state] (where state is BIT(i)/1<<i) inside the loop body (FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: ensure arr is a concrete array (not an unknown pointer) with a compile-time-resolvable length or a resolvable maximum designated index (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).

3) Step 3: Determine the array’s effective capacity L. Signals: length from the array type or, if declared with designated initializers, derive L as (max designated index + 1), e.g., highest BIT(k) yields L = 2^k + 1 (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: if L cannot be resolved to a constant, do not flag.

4) Step 4: Infer the loop counter’s maximum value M. Signals: a monotonic increasing loop with a simple condition i < C or i <= C where C is a compile-time constant; for i < 7, M = 6 (PATCH_DIFF, FUNCTION_CONTENT). FP mitigation: only handle simple linear loops; otherwise, skip to reduce uncertainty.

5) Step 5: Compute the largest in-loop index produced from the counter. Signals: maximum index is 1<<M (e.g., BIT(6) == 64) (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: if M is not constant or cannot be derived, skip.

6) Step 6: Compare computed index bound to array capacity and flag potential OOB. Signals: flag when (1<<M) >= L, e.g., 64 >= 33 in the cited case (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: confirm that arr[state] is reachable on at least one path without an intervening bounds guard.

7) Step 7: Check for explicit bounds guards on the index before array access. Signals: a condition in the same path ensuring state < L or equivalent prior to arr[state]. FP mitigation: if such a guard dominates the access, do not flag.

8) Step 8: Strengthen confidence if the state is also used as a bitmask against a flags variable. Signals: if (!(mask & state)) continue; pattern indicates per-bit iteration which does not constrain state to array bounds (FUNCTION_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: use this pattern as an additional positive signal but do not require it.

9) Step 9: Prefer non-reporting when the loop bound is tied to the array’s length idiomatically. Signals: bound uses ARRAY_SIZE(arr) or sizeof-derived computation referencing the same array (PATCH_DIFF). FP mitigation: treat this as a strong safe heuristic even if precise math on BIT and length is complex; only flag if a separate comparison shows inevitable OOB despite the idiom.

10) Step 10: Prioritize arrays with sparse designated initializers indexed by power-of-two constants. Signals: highest designated initializer at BIT(k) (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: this pattern reduces FPs by focusing on the exact risky layout seen in the CVE.

3. Target Elements
- For/while loops with integer counters.
- Assignments that compute a bitmask from the loop counter (state = BIT(i) or 1<<i).
- Array subscript expressions where the index is the bitmask variable or the shift expression.
- Array declarations/definitions (to resolve length or maximum designated index).
- Conditional statements in-loop that may guard array access.
- Bitwise-and uses of the bitmask with a flags/status variable.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track value flow from the loop counter to the index expression via BIT(i)/1<<i.
- Propagate constant bounds from loop conditions to derive maximum i.
- Track dominance/path conditions to ensure arr[state] is reachable without a prior bounds check.
- Resolve array capacity from type or designated initializer maxima, if available in the same compilation unit.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch pattern from FUNCTION_CONTENT with for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) and arr[BIT(i)], where array capacity L corresponds to a highest BIT(5) initializer; expect a report due to BIT(6) >= L (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Negative: Post-patch loop using i < ARRAY_SIZE(csts_state_names) as the bound (PATCH_DIFF); expect no report per the safe-idiom heuristic in Step 9.
- Negative: A loop that uses state = BIT(i) but guards with if (state < ARRAY_SIZE(arr)) before arr[state]; expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Include a small array with sparse designated initializers up to BIT(5) and the described loop; include variants with and without guard conditions and with bounds tied to ARRAY_SIZE.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High: Requires range analysis on loop counters, constant evaluation of array sizes (including designated initializers), and path-sensitivity for guard checks; the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in kernel code.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Arrays whose length or designated maxima cannot be resolved: mitigate by only reporting when L is known.
- Complex loop bounds or non-monotonic counters: mitigate by restricting to simple linear loops.
- Idiomatic fixes using ARRAY_SIZE that still look suspicious mathematically: mitigate by suppressing when bounds are expressed via ARRAY_SIZE(arr) on the same array (PATCH_DIFF).
- Macro-induced opacity (BIT, designated initializers): mitigate by requiring constant-foldable expressions and resolvable macros.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes the array’s effective capacity can be resolved from type info or the highest designated initializer; if not, the checker may miss issues or suppress reports (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS references designated initializers not fully shown).
- Assumes BIT(i) or 1<<i is recognizable as a power-of-two index; other equivalent formulations may be missed.
- Does not comprehensively handle cross-translation-unit resolution if array definitions are external.
- Treats use of ARRAY_SIZE(arr) in loop bounds as a safe heuristic per PATCH_DIFF, even though precise safety depends on the relationship between bit indices and array length.
