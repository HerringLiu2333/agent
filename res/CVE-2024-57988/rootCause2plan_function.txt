1. Plan Summary
Detect kernel code paths where the result of devm_kstrdup (or similar devm_* allocation helpers) is used without a preceding NULL check, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference (e.g., in strreplace), as exemplified by btbcm_get_board_name.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Identify allocation sites returning potentially NULL.
   Signals — Calls to devm_kstrdup with a pointer-typed result captured in a variable; note that [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] state devm_kstrdup can return NULL.
   FP mitigation — Restrict to devm_kstrdup and devm_* helpers documented in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] as possibly returning NULL; ensure the call’s result is used as a pointer.

2) Step 2: Objective — Bind the variable that receives the allocation result and its first use.
   Signals — Assignment “var = devm_kstrdup(...);” and subsequent references to var in the same function body (as shown in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]).
   FP mitigation — Only consider the first post-assignment use along feasible control-flow paths; ignore later uses if an earlier NULL guard exists.

3) Step 3: Objective — Detect absence of a NULL check on the allocated pointer before the first dereference-like use.
   Signals — No intervening conditionals such as “if (!var)” or equivalent early-return/goto error flows between assignment and use (added in [PATCH_DIFF] to fix the issue).
   FP mitigation — Recognize basic NULL-check idioms (negation, comparison to NULL) and early exits; tolerate macro-wrapped checks if they syntactically compare the variable to NULL.

4) Step 4: Objective — Identify unsafe sink calls that dereference the pointer.
   Signals — A call to strreplace(var, …) with var as the first argument (as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] states strreplace dereferences the pointer.
   FP mitigation — Confirm var is not reassigned to a known non-NULL value prior to the sink; ensure the sink is reachable on the same path that lacks a NULL check.

5) Step 5: Objective — Generalize to other dereference operations.
   Signals — Use of var in expressions that imply dereference (e.g., passing to known functions that operate on strings, or operations equivalent to indexing/assignment); map to the root cause by treating such uses as potential dereferences akin to strreplace.
   FP mitigation — Limit to well-known deref-like operations in kernel string handling where the first parameter is a modifiable char*; avoid flagging mere comparisons or returns without modification.

6) Step 6: Objective — Validate allocation failure feasibility.
   Signals — Calls using GFP_KERNEL (as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]) and the known behavior from [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] that devm_kstrdup can return NULL.
   FP mitigation — Skip cases where var is immediately checked or where code comments/assertions explicitly guarantee non-NULL (none shown here, but accommodate if present).

7) Step 7: Objective — Confirm the vulnerable path is within CONFIG_OF-enabled code paths (context).
   Signals — Code guarded by CONFIG_OF (seen in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]); ensure the analysis considers the enabled branch where the vulnerable sequence occurs.
   FP mitigation — Do not flag code outside the CONFIG_OF branch if equivalent sequences are absent; avoid paths that return NULL before the allocation site (e.g., when root or tmp retrieval fails).

8) Step 8: Objective — Exclude safe patterns introduced by the patch.
   Signals — Presence of “if (!var) return NULL;” directly after the allocation (as added in [PATCH_DIFF]).
   FP mitigation — If such a check exists before any dereference-like sink, do not report.

3. Target Elements
- Functions in drivers where devm_kstrdup is called.
- Call sites that assign the result of devm_kstrdup to a local pointer variable.
- Condition checks comparing the allocated pointer to NULL and control-flow exits (return/goto).
- Subsequent uses of the pointer in sink functions (e.g., strreplace) or dereference-like operations.
- Preprocessor-conditioned branches (e.g., CONFIG_OF) that affect reachability.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track intra-procedural flow from the allocation assignment to the first use.
- Model guards that dominate the path (e.g., “if (!var) return …”) as sanitizers that break the error path.
- Ensure the sink is on a path reachable without passing through a sanitizer.
- Recognize simple reassignments that may overwrite var with a known non-NULL value before use.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: The pre-patch btbcm_get_board_name in [FUNCTION_CONTENT], where board_type = devm_kstrdup(...) is followed by strreplace(board_type, …) without a NULL check; expect a report.
- Negative: The post-patch version in [PATCH_DIFF] with “if (!board_type) return NULL;” before strreplace; expect no report.
- Test harness notes: Run on drivers/bluetooth/btbcm.c with CONFIG_OF path enabled; add synthetic variants where the check exists or is missing to verify path sensitivity.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — Focused pattern in kernel drivers with high impact (DoS via NULL deref), but limited scope around devm_kstrdup and known deref sinks.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Functions where the sink tolerates NULL (not the case for strreplace per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); mitigate by enumerating known deref sinks like strreplace.
- Complex macro-based NULL checks not recognized; mitigate by supporting common kernel NULL-check idioms.
- Inter-procedural guarantees (e.g., caller ensures non-NULL) not visible; mitigate by scoping to intra-procedural paths and documented sinks.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes strreplace dereferences its first argument as per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]; no broader sink catalog is provided.
- Assumes devm_kstrdup and similar devm_* helpers can return NULL (stated in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); other allocators are not enumerated.
- Does not infer complex inter-procedural non-NULL contracts or memory-pressure conditions; focuses on syntactic/semantic absence of a local NULL check.
