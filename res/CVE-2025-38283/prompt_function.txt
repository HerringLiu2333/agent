1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38283

2. Vulnerability Type
Improper input validation leading to unsafe device programming (NULL DMA address use) and potential denial of service during VF live migration resume.

3. Root Cause Summary
The destination-side resume path did not validate that migrated DMA base addresses (eqe_dma, aeqe_dma, sqc_dma, cqc_dma) were non-zero before programming the device. In vf_qm_load_data(), these fields were blindly assigned and then used in mailbox commands to configure queue tables (“qm->sqc_dma = vf_data->sqc_dma; … hisi_qm_mb(qm, QM_MB_CMD_SQC_BT, qm->sqc_dma, …)”). Additionally, the VF QM state was not initialized or set to NOT_READY when no valid queue data was present, allowing subsequent recovery logic to proceed on invalid inputs. This allowed attempting to resume with NULL DMA addresses, causing device accesses to address 0 and migration failure/device errors.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
VFIO PCI driver for HiSilicon accelerator (hisi_acc_vfio_pci), live migration resume path.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- vf_qm_load_data() did not check vf_data->{eqe_dma, aeqe_dma, sqc_dma, cqc_dma} for NULL/zero before using them to program hardware via mailbox commands.
- hisi_acc_vfio_pci_migrn_init_dev() did not initialize hisi_acc_vdev->vf_qm_state, and vf_qm_load_data() did not set it to NOT_READY on invalid inputs, enabling queue recovery attempts with invalid state.

3) Trigger Condition:
Attempting live migration of a VF when the guest OS does not have the VF device driver loaded, resulting in migrated acc_vf_data containing zero (NULL) DMA addresses.

4) Impact Mechanism:
The driver issues mailbox commands (QM_MB_CMD_SQC_BT/CQC_BT) with zero DMA addresses, causing the device to access a null address (address 0). This leads to access errors, device malfunction, and migration failure (denial of service for the VF/function).

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Input validation: Bail out early if any required DMA address is NULL and mark the VF QM as not ready.
- State initialization: Initialize vf_qm_state to QM_NOT_READY during device migration init to avoid accidental recovery on empty data.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In vf_qm_load_data():
  - Added check: if (!vf_data->eqe_dma || !vf_data->aeqe_dma || !vf_data->sqc_dma || !vf_data->cqc_dma) { dev_info(...); hisi_acc_vdev->vf_qm_state = QM_NOT_READY; return 0; }
  - Prevents executing qm_set_regs() and hisi_qm_mb() with NULL DMA addresses.
- In hisi_acc_vfio_pci_migrn_init_dev():
  - Added hisi_acc_vdev->vf_qm_state = QM_NOT_READY; to ensure a safe initial state for migration handling.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
No locking or concurrency semantics were changed. The fix is purely input validation and state initialization; existing mutexes (state_mutex, open_mutex) remain unchanged.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
Validating migration data before programming hardware is critical in VFIO contexts to prevent device DMA to unintended addresses. Without such checks, malformed or incomplete migration data can lead to device errors or DoS on the destination host. Establishing explicit NOT_READY states helps gate recovery logic and reduces the risk of unsafe operations during complex migration sequences.
