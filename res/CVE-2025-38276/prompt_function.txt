1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38276

2. Vulnerability Type
Incorrect iterator state handling under lock drop (concurrency/logic bug causing entry skip)

3. Root Cause Summary
wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive() used xas_pause(xas) before dropping the XArray lock, which advances the iterator state to the next index. The function (and its callers) then reload the entry via xas_load(xas) after reacquiring the lock, inadvertently loading the next index instead of the original entry being waited on. This causes the currently locked DAX entry to be skipped during scans, violating scan correctness and leading to exceptional entries not being processed as intended.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
fs/dax (Direct Access) interacting with XArray iteration and truncate paths.

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- In wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive(), the sequence:
  - prepare_to_wait_exclusive(...);
  - xas_pause(xas);
  - xas_unlock_irq(xas);
  - schedule();
  - ... entry = xas_load(xas);
  advances xas to the next index due to xas_pause(), so xas_load() no longer refers to the entry just waited on.
- xas_for_each() normally compensates for xas_pause(), but this path performs a direct xas_load() instead of iterating, defeating that safeguard.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Encountering a locked DAX exceptional entry during XArray scanning that requires waiting (e.g., during truncate or pagecache/exceptions removal), leading wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive() to drop the XArray lock and sleep.
- Reproduction observed with xfstests generic/068 on XFS with FS DAX enabled.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- The locked entry being waited on is skipped when scanning resumes, leaving an exceptional DAX entry unprocessed in the XArray.
- This breaks expectations in truncate paths, intermittently triggering warnings in truncate_folio_batch_exceptionals(), and may leave stale entries or inconsistencies until later passes.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
Replace xas_pause(xas) with xas_reset(xas) before dropping the XArray lock so that the iterator state does not advance, ensuring the subsequent xas_load(xas) reloads the same index that was waited on.

2) Key Code Changes:
- Single-line change in wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive():
  - xas_pause(xas) -> xas_reset(xas)
- As described, xas_reset() is equivalent in preparing state for unlock but does not advance to the next index, preventing the skip.

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- The function still correctly drops the XArray lock to wait on the waitqueue and reacquires it afterward.
- Using xas_reset() preserves the iterator index across the lock drop, aligning with the intended semantics of “wait without advancing,” restoring atomicity of “wait then reload same entry” across the sleep and eliminating the race/skip window introduced by xas_pause().

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Ensures correctness of DAX exceptional entry scanning, preventing skipped entries that can trigger WARNs and violate truncate/invalidation invariants.
- Avoids potential denial of service on systems configured with panic_on_warn=1 and reduces risk of filesystem state inconsistencies caused by incomplete processing of exceptional entries.
- Reinforces correct XArray iterator handling patterns when dropping locks to wait, which is broadly applicable to other XArray-using subsystems.
