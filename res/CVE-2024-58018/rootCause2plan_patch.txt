1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence was provided to identify the specific vulnerability class; this plan outlines a patch-diff–driven strategy to derive detection signals once [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — Derive the missing precondition(s) from the patch. Conceptual signals — Identify newly added or strengthened guards (e.g., conditionals, early returns, parameter/return validations, capability/permission checks) and relate them to specific variables or API calls modified in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Restrict inference to constructs explicitly introduced or altered by the patch.

2) Step 2: Objective — Localize the affected API boundaries. Conceptual signals — From [PATCH_DIFF], collect the functions whose signatures, prologues, or error handling changed and note added annotations or invariants. FP mitigation — Focus on exact functions and their immediate callers detected in Step 1.

3) Step 3: Objective — Infer the unsafe pattern before the fix. Conceptual signals — Find occurrences (pre-patch) where the guarded condition is absent before dereference/use, length/index operations, authorization, lock use, or resource operations indicated in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Require that the operation is of the same kind and involves the same variables/resources highlighted by the patch.

4) Step 4: Objective — Identify sinks that require the added guard. Conceptual signals — From [PATCH_DIFF], map the guarded variables to the operations that follow (e.g., dereference, arithmetic, copy, call into a sink API, state transition). FP mitigation — Match only the same sink call(s) or operation kind found in the patch.

5) Step 5: Objective — Build a control-flow predicate for the missing check. Conceptual signals — Determine the precise predicate added (null/size/range/state/permission/lock-held/refcount/result-code) from [PATCH_DIFF] or [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]; represent “sink must be dominated by this check.” FP mitigation — Accept only paths where no equivalent check dominates the sink.

6) Step 6: Objective — Track dataflow from source to sink as indicated by the fix. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] shows validation of parameters, return values, or user-controlled data before a sink, track flows from those sources to the sink and ensure validation is on-path. FP mitigation — Require same source kinds (e.g., same parameter index or same API family) and same sink kind.

7) Step 7: Objective — Model state transitions enforced by the patch. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] adds state updates (e.g., acquire lock, increment refcount, set initialized flag) before a sink, detect prior usages lacking this state. FP mitigation — Only report when the same state variable/lock/refcount is involved and no equivalent update dominates the use.

8) Step 8: Objective — Capture error handling/return-value expectations introduced by the patch. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] adds checks on return codes and early exits, flag sites that call the same API but ignore or misuse the returned status before proceeding to the sink. FP mitigation — Confirm absence of any branching on the relevant status or a default-fail path.

9) Step 9: Objective — Propagate the requirement to callers if the patch moved validation into callees. Conceptual signals — If [PATCH_DIFF] adds internal checks within a callee, find other callee variants or older versions lacking them and flag call sites that don’t perform equivalent pre-checks. FP mitigation — Constrain to the same function family or signatures implicated by the patch.

10) Step 10: Objective — Exclude equivalent protections. Conceptual signals — Recognize logically equivalent guards (e.g., prior range checks, sanitizer functions, privilege gates, invariant assertions) already dominating the sink even if syntactically different. FP mitigation — Maintain a small whitelist of known guard APIs or macros mentioned in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] once available.

11) Step 11: Objective — Handle interprocedural propagation. Conceptual signals — If validation happens in helper functions introduced by the patch, ensure the checker recognizes those helpers as validators and skips reporting when they dominate the sink on all paths. FP mitigation — Require that validator is called with the same data and its success result is checked.

12) Step 12: Objective — Reduce noise via path feasibility. Conceptual signals — Ensure a realizable control-flow path exists from source to sink without the added guard, accounting for early returns introduced in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — Discard paths blocked by existing guards or impossible conditions.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified in [PATCH_DIFF], including their callers and callees.
- Condition checks and early returns added or modified by the patch.
- Call sites to APIs whose return values or states are newly validated in the patch.
- Resource/state operations (locking, refcounting, initialization flags) introduced or reordered.
- Allocation, dereference, indexing, copy/move, permission/authorization checks, and error handling branches connected to the patch changes.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flows from inputs or return values that are newly validated in [PATCH_DIFF] to the sinks where they are used.
- Require that the same variable/parameter/return value reaches the sink without passing through the added validator/guard on at least one feasible path.
- Model stateful requirements: ensure state-establishing operations (lock-acquire, refcount-increment, init) dominate the sink; report when dataflows to sink without those transitions.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch snippet mirroring the same sink operation without the guard/validation/state update added in the patch; the checker should report the missing guard on the path to the sink.
- Negative: Post-patch snippet where the guard/validation/state change dominates all paths to the sink (including helpers), and variants with equivalent guards that should suppress findings.
- Test harness notes: Construct small, single-file and interprocedural cases reflecting the exact guard, sink, and state patterns derived from [PATCH_DIFF]; include edge cases with alternative but equivalent checks.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High — Without [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS], the checker must be parameterized post hoc to the specific vulnerability pattern once details are provided.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Semantically equivalent guards expressed differently; mitigate via dominance and recognized validator functions from the patch description.
- Paths infeasible due to earlier checks; mitigate with path feasibility and dominance analysis.
- Different API semantics across overloads or platforms; mitigate by constraining to the exact function signatures/families changed in the patch.
- Macro-expanded checks not recognized; mitigate by mapping macro names from the patch to their underlying semantics.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DIFF], [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the exact vulnerability class, sinks, guards, and APIs are unknown.
- Programming language, framework, and project context are unknown, limiting precision of element targeting.
- The plan assumes the patch introduces explicit guard(s) or state changes that can be converted into preconditions; if the fix is a deep algorithmic rewrite, additional bespoke modeling will be required.
