1. Plan Summary
Insufficient evidence to identify the specific vulnerability class; propose a differential, patch-driven detection plan template that derives the missing precondition(s) or guard(s) from the patch and flags equivalent pre-patch usages that omit those guards.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — derive the fix pattern from the patch; Signals — identify added conditions/checks, early returns, capability/permission checks, bounds/length validations, null/invalid-state checks, lock/unlock pairs, or error handling introduced in [PATCH_DIFF]; FP mitigation — none (discovery step, not reporting).
2) Step 2: Objective — locate the protected API(s) or resource(s); Signals — from [PATCH_DIFF], extract the function(s)/method(s)/APIs whose calls are now guarded or whose contracts are clarified in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]; FP mitigation — restrict to exact APIs and receiver types present in the patch.
3) Step 3: Objective — formalize the guard predicate(s); Signals — model the logical predicate(s) added (e.g., param != null, size within range, auth/role check true, state flag set, lock held) and the scope it must dominate (AST control-flow guarding calls/assignments); FP mitigation — require the guard to be syntactically or semantically equivalent to what the patch added.
4) Step 4: Objective — identify call sites lacking the guard; Signals — find pre-patch call sites to the same API(s)/resource(s) where the guard predicate does not dominate the call or where the early-return/error handling is absent; FP mitigation — exclude sites proven unreachable or already checked via equivalent preconditions.
5) Step 5: Objective — handle dataflow-equivalent guards; Signals — recognize guards performed in helper functions or earlier in the call chain that ensure the same predicate holds (e.g., validated parameter object); FP mitigation — credit validations when control/dataflow shows the same predicate necessarily true.
6) Step 6: Objective — detect missing error handling where the patch added it; Signals — find uses of return values or outputs where the patch added checks for error/sentinel values and subsequent safe handling; FP mitigation — exclude sites where the return value is not consumed or is already handled equivalently.
7) Step 7: Objective — detect missing synchronization if the patch added locking; Signals — from [PATCH_DIFF], capture added lock acquisitions around shared-state access and flag accesses to the same state without the lock; FP mitigation — exclude contexts proven single-threaded or already protected by equivalent synchronization.
8) Step 8: Objective — detect missing capability/permission checks if the patch added them; Signals — identify sensitive calls/resources now gated by auth/permission checks and flag sites calling them without the same gate; FP mitigation — exclude trusted/internal contexts identified in the patch comments or documentation in [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], if present.
9) Step 9: Objective — map resource lifecycle fixes; Signals — if [PATCH_DIFF] adds initialization/finalization ordering or nulling/freeing before use, infer the resource’s required state and flag uses that violate it; FP mitigation — honor paths where state is proven initialized/valid.
10) Step 10: Objective — differentiate benign refactors; Signals — ignore changes unrelated to safety (e.g., renames, logging) and focus only on semantics listed in Steps 1–9; FP mitigation — require that the fix pattern is semantically safety-relevant (guard, bound, lock, permission, lifecycle).
11) Step 11: Objective — constrain by file/module scope; Signals — limit search to modules/files/packages touched in [PATCH_DIFF]/[FILE_CONTENT] to avoid cross-project drift; FP mitigation — further restrict to same versioned API surface.
12) Step 12: Objective — prioritize likely-exploitable paths; Signals — rank findings where unguarded calls are reachable from externally influenced entry points (public APIs, request handlers, IPC) per [FILE_CONTENT]; FP mitigation — deprioritize purely test code or non-production paths.

3. Target Elements
- Function/method definitions and their call sites touched by the patch.
- Condition checks and control-flow guards introduced in the patch (null, bounds, state, permission).
- Return-value uses where new error/NULL/sentinel checks were added.
- Locking/synchronization boundaries added (mutex, RW lock, atomic guards).
- Resource lifecycle operations (alloc/init/open vs use vs free/close) that were reordered or guarded by the patch.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track whether inputs to guarded APIs are validated along all paths before use.
- Propagate predicate knowledge (e.g., param != null, size <= N, permission is granted) across dominated blocks and through simple helper wrappers.
- Model aliasing of guarded resources to ensure equivalent protections apply when passed through variables/fields.
- Track return values from sensitive APIs to ensure postconditions introduced by the patch are observed before further use.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch snippet calling the patched API without the new guard (e.g., missing null/length/permission/lock check) that now would be guarded in the patch; expect a finding.
- Negative: A call site with an equivalent guard logically dominating the call (even if via a helper function); expect no finding.
- Test harness notes: Instantiate minimal stubs of the APIs and the exact guard predicate(s) reflected by [PATCH_DIFF]; verify control-flow dominance and dataflow-aware equivalence are recognized.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium — requires differential analysis of the patch to synthesize guard predicates and moderate interprocedural dataflow to suppress false positives.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent but non-syntactic guards (mitigate via predicate equivalence and dataflow reasoning).
- Contexts where the guard is enforced by construction (framework invariants); mitigate via module/entrypoint scoping and recognition of factory-validated objects.
- Single-threaded contexts falsely flagged for missing locks; mitigate via thread model heuristics and annotations if available.
- Benign calls to non-sensitive variants of the API; mitigate by binding to the exact symbols/types changed in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the concrete vulnerability class and exact guard predicates are unknown.
- The plan assumes the patch adds explicit guard(s)/synchronization/lifecycle handling that can be mechanically identified and generalized; if the fix is purely algorithmic or semantic without explicit guards, this approach may not apply.
- Entry-point identification and trust boundaries may be unavailable in the codebase, limiting exploitability ranking.
