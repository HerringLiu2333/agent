1. Plan Summary
Detect uses of the return value from of_alias_get_id that index arrays (e.g., gpio_chips[alias_idx]) without a preceding non-negative validation, especially when only an upper-bound BUG_ON check exists.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Find sources that can produce negative indices. Signals: Identify variables assigned from calls to of_alias_get_id(...) (based on [PATCH_DIFF] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation: Limit to direct assignments or simple propagation in the same function.
2) Step 2: Objective: Track the “possibly-negative ID” value to indexing uses. Signals: Array subscripts or pointer arithmetic where the tainted variable is used as an index (e.g., arr[idx], *(arr + idx)). FP mitigation: Require that the array-like object is a real array or a known array-like global/field (e.g., gpio_chips as per [PATCH_DIFF]), not an arbitrary pointer without evidence of bound knowledge.
3) Step 3: Objective: Verify presence of a lower-bound guard. Signals: A dominating condition that checks idx < 0 and exits to an error path (return, goto error, or early exit) before any index use (as in the fix in [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation: Require dominance/path-sensitive gating; ignore checks that do not preclude the subsequent index (e.g., idx < 0 followed by continuing execution).
4) Step 4: Objective: Recognize insufficient reliance on only upper-bound checks. Signals: Presence of checks like BUG_ON(idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(arr)) or similar upper-bound guards without any idx < 0 guard (based on [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation: Do not treat BUG_ON or similar assertions as sufficient validation; still require a lower-bound check to consider safe.
5) Step 5: Objective: Confirm a reachable unsafe path. Signals: Existence of a control-flow path from the assignment of the of_alias_get_id result to an array index use with no intervening idx < 0 error-return gate. FP mitigation: Exclude paths where every route to the use is gated by a negative check and early exit.
6) Step 6: Objective: Account for common index-use patterns. Signals: Uses such as if (arr[idx]) ..., arr[idx] = ..., reading/writing, or taking address &arr[idx] (as seen in [PATCH_DIFF] with gpio_chips[alias_idx]). FP mitigation: Exclude cases where idx is provably a compile-time non-negative constant.
7) Step 7: Objective: Avoid false confidence from type changes alone. Signals: Casting idx to unsigned before indexing without an explicit lower-bound check is not a safeguard (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] emphasis on explicit lower-bound validation). FP mitigation: Only accept explicit idx < 0 guards; do not treat unsigned casts as safe.
8) Step 8: Objective: Highlight missing validation even when “size” checks exist. Signals: Checks comparing idx with ARRAY_SIZE(arr) or constants without a companion idx < 0 check (mirroring the pre-patch flaw in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation: Ensure the flagged use actually indexes the array on a path not gated by idx < 0 handling.

3. Target Elements
- Function call sites to of_alias_get_id and the receiving variables.
- Array subscripts and pointer arithmetic using the received value as an index.
- Conditional checks/guards around the index variable (idx < 0, idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(...)).
- Early-exit statements tied to negative-check guards (return, goto error).
- Macro-like assertions such as BUG_ON and BUG around the index variable.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Treat the return from of_alias_get_id as a “possibly-negative ID” taint source.
- Propagate through local assignments, simple expressions, and phi/conditional merges within the same function.
- Stop propagation at explicit lower-bound validation that leads to an early return/goto error dominating the use.
- Consider the path-sensitive dominance of guards; only flag if a tainted value reaches an index expression without a prior idx < 0 exit.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Code that assigns alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio"); performs BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)); then uses gpio_chips[alias_idx] without any alias_idx < 0 check (as in pre-patch [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] and [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Negative: Code that assigns alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(...); immediately checks if (alias_idx < 0) return alias_idx; then uses gpio_chips[alias_idx] (matches the fix in [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Test harness notes: Include variants where the only validation is BUG_ON upper-bound; include both read and write indexing; include a case with idx < 0 guard that does not return (should still flag because use remains reachable).

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Indirect validation patterns (e.g., helper functions) not recognized as lower-bound guards; mitigate by focusing on explicit idx < 0 checks with early exit in the same function.
- Complex control flow where the analysis misses dominance; mitigate with path-sensitive dominance checks to ensure guards actually precede uses.
- Arrays that are actually validated elsewhere; mitigate by restricting to same-function validation unless interprocedural summaries are available.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes of_alias_get_id can return negative values on error (per [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); other functions with similar contracts are not covered.
- Does not prove upper-bound safety; focuses on missing lower-bound validation as per the CVE root cause.
- Treats BUG/BUG_ON as non-sufficient runtime validation (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]); build-time configuration nuances are not modeled.
