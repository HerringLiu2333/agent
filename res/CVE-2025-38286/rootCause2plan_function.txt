1. Plan Summary
Detect uses of the return value from of_alias_get_id used as an array index (or to derive an index) without a preceding negative-value check, which can lead to out-of-bounds access when the function returns a negative error.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — identify sources of potentially negative indices. Signals — locate call sites of of_alias_get_id and capture the result variable or expression (based on [PATCH_DIFF] and [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — scope to this API since [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] states it returns negative on error.

2) Step 2: Objective — find unsafe array index uses. Signals — dataflow from the captured result to array subscripts (x[alias_idx] or x[expr including alias_idx]) and to writes like x[alias_idx] = ... (as in gpio_chips[alias_idx] in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — require that the use is a concrete array or pointer subscript in C, not a non-index use (e.g., skip pure logging).

3) Step 3: Objective — verify presence of a guarding negative check before first index use. Signals — dominating control tests like (alias_idx < 0) that lead to early return/goto error/propagation of the error code (as added in [PATCH_DIFF]). FP mitigation — require the check to dominate all paths to the first array access; ignore assertions/BUG-like macros.

4) Step 4: Objective — recognize insufficient upper-bound-only checks. Signals — detect checks of the form alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(array) or comparisons against a maximum (e.g., BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(...))) without any explicit alias_idx < 0 guard (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]). FP mitigation — treat BUG_ON/ASSERT-style checks as non-mitigating because [PATCH_DESCRIPTION] states BUG() can be compiled out.

5) Step 5: Objective — catch read and write out-of-bounds risks. Signals — both reading x[alias_idx] and writing x[alias_idx] = ... should be flagged if Step 3 fails (as both occur in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — require at least one actual array subscript reachable after the source; do not flag if the variable is never used as an index.

6) Step 6: Objective — detect derived index uses via simple arithmetic. Signals — uses where alias_idx participates in forming an index or offset (e.g., base = alias_idx * K) that is then used to index/offset memory or arrays later in the same function (as noted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] “downstream misuse”). FP mitigation — only flag when the derived value feeds (intra-procedurally) into an array/pointer access without a dominating alias_idx < 0 guard.

7) Step 7: Objective — avoid flagging when safe normalization is evident. Signals — explicit checks that ensure alias_idx is forced non-negative before use (e.g., if (alias_idx < 0) return alias_idx) as in [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation — require that normalization or early return occurs before any index use on all paths.

8) Step 8: Objective — de-emphasize cases protected solely by compile-time or non-failing constructs. Signals — if the only “check” is a macro like BUG_ON/ASSERT that doesn’t alter control flow (per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]), consider it insufficient. FP mitigation — only treat runtime control-flow enforcing checks (return/goto/err) as valid guards.

9) Step 9: Objective — prioritize high-impact arrays. Signals — global/static arrays (e.g., gpio_chips in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]) indexed by alias_idx; these are more likely to cause memory corruption. FP mitigation — rank findings higher for globals and writes; still report locals but lower severity.

10) Step 10: Objective — report multiple uses efficiently. Signals — aggregate all array index sites within the function tied to the same source and report the first unsafe use plus a summary of subsequent uses (e.g., both read and write in [FUNCTION_CONTENT]). FP mitigation — single consolidated finding per source variable per function to reduce noise.

3. Target Elements
- Function call sites: of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio").
- Variables assigned from the call result (alias_idx-like).
- Array/pointer subscript expressions that use the variable or expressions derived from it.
- Conditional checks and control-flow that may guard uses (if, return, goto).
- BUG_ON/ASSERT-like macro calls that are upper-bound-only checks.
- Assignments where the variable influences index-related fields (e.g., base/id) that feed subsequent indexing in the same function.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track dataflow from the of_alias_get_id return value through assignments and simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication by constants) to array/pointer subscript uses within the same function.
- Establish dominance/path checks to ensure whether a negative-value check (alias_idx < 0 leading to exit) guards all paths to each index use.
- Treat upper-bound-only checks as non-sanitizing; treat early return on negative as sanitizing.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Function assigns alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(...); checks only BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(arr)); then accesses arr[alias_idx] and later arr[alias_idx] = ...; expect a finding for missing negative check (as in [FUNCTION_CONTENT] and [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]).
- Negative: Same pattern but immediately after assignment performs if (alias_idx < 0) return alias_idx; then proceeds to use arr[alias_idx]; expect no finding (as in [PATCH_DIFF]).
- Test harness notes: Include cases with derived use (alias_idx * K feeding an index) and ensure dominance analysis respects early returns; include a case where alias_idx is only logged or stored but never used to index to confirm no finding.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: requires intra-procedural dataflow and simple dominance analysis; high impact per kernel memory safety implications noted in [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS].

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Negative checks hidden in helper functions or macros not modeled as control-flow exits — mitigate by focusing on explicit in-function guards.
- Complex sanitization patterns (e.g., clamping to non-negative) not recognized — mitigate by restricting to clear (alias_idx < 0) early-exit guards.
- Paths where the index use is unreachable — mitigate with basic path feasibility/dominance checks to require reachability from the source.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes only of_alias_get_id is a relevant negative-on-error source (per [PATCH_DIFF]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS]); other APIs are not covered due to lack of evidence.
- Does not model inter-procedural guards or kernel config that might alter macro behavior; per [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], BUG() may be compiled out, so it is treated as non-protective.
- Cannot prove later uses of fields like base/id will cause OOB without explicit intra-procedural indexing; such cases are reported only when access is observable in-function.
