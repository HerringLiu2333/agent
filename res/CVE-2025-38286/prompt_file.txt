1. CVE Identifier
CVE-2025-38286

2. Vulnerability Type
Out-of-bounds array access (negative/unchecked index) leading to potential memory corruption

3. Root Cause Summary
The AT91 GPIO probe path failed to validate the return value of of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio"). A negative alias index (error/no alias) was then used to index the global gpio_chips[] array and to compute bases, causing out-of-bounds reads/writes. The only bounds guard present was BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)), which neither checks for negative indices nor is reliable if BUG() is compiled out.

4. Kernel Subsystem Analysis
1) Affected Subsystem:
- Pinctrl/GPIO driver for Atmel/Microchip AT91 (drivers/pinctrl, function at91_gpio_probe)

2) Pre-Patch Flaw:
- at91_gpio_probe() assigned alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio") and immediately used it as an index and for arithmetic without checking alias_idx < 0.
- Code then accessed gpio_chips[alias_idx] and later wrote gpio_chips[alias_idx] = at91_chip; and derived chip->base/range->base from alias_idx.
- Only an upper-bound BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)) existed, which does not catch negative values and may be compiled out.

3) Trigger Condition:
- Device tree lacks a valid "gpio" OF alias for the node or of_alias_get_id() otherwise fails (returns a negative error code).
- Alternatively, if the alias index is >= MAX_GPIO_BANKS and BUG() is compiled out, the upper bound is also unchecked.

4) Impact Mechanism:
- Using a negative alias_idx causes out-of-bounds array access on gpio_chips[] (both read and write), corrupting adjacent kernel memory.
- Memory corruption can manifest as kernel crashes (DoS) or undefined behavior; precise exploitation impact is not determinable from the provided materials.

5. Patch Analysis
1) Fix Approach:
- Introduce explicit error handling for of_alias_get_id() by returning early when alias_idx < 0, preventing its use as an array index or in arithmetic.

2) Key Code Changes:
- In at91_gpio_probe():
  - Moved alias_idx declaration, then:
    alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio");
    if (alias_idx < 0)
        return alias_idx;
  - The rest of the logic remains unchanged, including the existing BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)).

3) Locking/Concurrency Impact:
- None. The change is purely a defensive argument check; no locking or ordering semantics were altered.

6. Broader Kernel Security Implications
- Drivers must not rely on BUG_ON for input/bounds validation, both because it can be compiled out and because it should not substitute for proper error handling.
- Any caller of of_alias_get_id() must validate negative return values before using them in array indices or computations.
- Similar patterns elsewhere in the kernel (DT alias-based indexing) should be audited to avoid negative-index OOB accesses and resultant memory corruption.
