1. Plan Summary
Detect uses of the return value from of_alias_get_id that are used as array indices or to derive indices without an explicit negative-value check, especially when only an upper-bound or BUG_ON guard is present.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Identify candidate index sources from DT aliases. Signals: Calls to of_alias_get_id(…, "gpio") whose return is stored in an int-like variable; this is the variable alias_idx in at91_gpio_probe (based on PATCH_DIFF and ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Restrict to Linux kernel tree patterns and known driver probe paths or functions named *probe.

2) Step 2: Objective: Track uses of that variable before any reassignment. Signals: Dataflow from the call result through simple assignments and arithmetic into expressions used to access arrays (e.g., arr[alias_idx]) or to compute offsets (e.g., base = alias_idx * CONST), as in gpio_chips[alias_idx] and chip->base = alias_idx * MAX_NB_GPIO_PER_BANK (FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Require that the array is a statically-sized or fixed-length array (e.g., declared with a macro constant like MAX_* or seen via ARRAY_SIZE).

3) Step 3: Objective: Detect unguarded negative-value usage. Signals: At each array-index use derived from alias_idx, check dominance for a prior conditional that ensures alias_idx >= 0 (e.g., if (alias_idx < 0) return … as added in PATCH_DIFF). FP mitigation: Consider only uses not dominated by a negative-check early-return/error path.

4) Step 4: Objective: Recognize insufficient guards that only check upper bounds. Signals: Presence of only upper-bound checks such as alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(array) or alias_idx >= MAX_* (possibly via BUG_ON/if) before the use (pre-patch used BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips))—FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Treat BUG_ON/BUILD_BUG_ON as non-sanitizing for runtime values (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS notes BUG can be compiled out); do not consider an upper-bound-only check sufficient.

5) Step 5: Objective: Flag array dereferences with potentially negative index. Signals: Reads or writes like array[alias_idx] or array_expr[alias_idx_derived] where alias_idx may be negative; in the sample, both read (if (gpio_chips[alias_idx])) and write (gpio_chips[alias_idx] = …) exist (FILE_CONTENT). FP mitigation: Prioritize write sites for higher confidence; require absence of dominating negative checks.

6) Step 6: Objective: Flag derived-index arithmetic used for pointer/offset computations. Signals: Arithmetic like alias_idx * CONST assigned to fields used later as offsets or bases for index computations (chip->base, range->pin_base) as shown (FILE_CONTENT); such derivations propagate negative values. FP mitigation: Only report if the derived value participates in later array-like operations or memory-mapped register indexing (e.g., used to form pin ranges), to align with impact in ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.

7) Step 7: Objective: Treat casts that could hide negativity as unsafe. Signals: Casts of alias_idx to unsigned or size_t before indexing without an explicit prior alias_idx >= 0 check. FP mitigation: Only treat as safe if there is an explicit negative check dominating the cast; casting alone is not a sanitizer.

8) Step 8: Objective: Identify reliance on BUG/BUG_ON instead of proper validation. Signals: Paths where the only “guard” is BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)) or similar, with no alias_idx < 0 handling (FILE_CONTENT, PATCH_DESCRIPTION, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Require subsequent unsafe use (array index or derived offset) to be present; do not flag mere presence of BUG_ON.

9) Step 9: Objective: Exclude properly fixed patterns. Signals: Presence of an explicit check like if (alias_idx < 0) return alias_idx; immediately after of_alias_get_id (as added in PATCH_DIFF). FP mitigation: Use control-flow dominance so any later use after that point in the same function is considered safe.

10) Step 10: Objective: Rank/report findings with context. Signals: Include whether the array is global and fixed-size (gpio_chips[MAX_GPIO_BANKS]) and whether both read and write occur, indicating higher risk (FILE_CONTENT, ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS). FP mitigation: Deprioritize findings where the array length or alias range can’t be determined and no write occurs.

3. Target Elements
- Calls to of_alias_get_id and their result variables.
- Array declarations with fixed bounds (e.g., static arrays with MAX_* or detected via ARRAY_SIZE).
- Array index expressions using the alias variable or values derived from it.
- Control-flow conditions checking the alias variable (negative checks and upper-bound checks).
- BUG_ON/BUG usage around bound checks.
- Assignments deriving bases/offsets from the alias variable used later in index-like contexts.

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track the taint from of_alias_get_id’s return value through assignments, arithmetic (e.g., multiplication by constants), and through fields storing derived indices (e.g., chip->base).
- Consider a sanitizer only when a dominating control predicate enforces alias_idx >= 0 and takes an error path otherwise.
- Treat upper-bound-only checks and BUG_ON as non-sanitizing for negative values.
- Propagate taint into array index expressions and memory-offset computations that lead to later array-like operations.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: Pre-patch at91_gpio_probe where alias_idx = of_alias_get_id(np,"gpio") is used in gpio_chips[alias_idx] without alias_idx < 0 check; only BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips)) present (FILE_CONTENT).
- Negative: Patched version where alias_idx is checked with if (alias_idx < 0) return alias_idx; subsequent uses proceed (PATCH_DIFF).
- Test harness notes: Run on a kernel subset with drivers/pinctrl content; assert that the checker flags the pre-patch function and produces no finding on the patched code.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High priority; medium effort to implement robust dominance and dataflow tracking for negative-check sanitization and array index uses.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Aliases guaranteed non-negative by external invariants not visible to analysis; mitigate with requirement for explicit in-function negative checks.
- Arrays whose true bounds equal or exceed possible alias ranges; mitigate by focusing on fixed-size arrays with known small MAX_* constants.
- Casts to unsigned that are safe due to prior checks not recognized; mitigate with dominance analysis and recognizing equivalent negative-check patterns.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- Assumes of_alias_get_id returns negative on error and non-negative indices otherwise (ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS).
- Cannot determine compile-time status of BUG(); hence treated as non-sanitizing per PATCH_DESCRIPTION/ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS.
- Does not infer dynamic array sizes or external constraints from device tree content; relies on code-local checks and static array declarations.
