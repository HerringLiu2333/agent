1. Plan Summary
No patch, file, or root-cause details were provided; therefore this plan outlines a diff-guided, guard-recovery detection approach that will identify the class of defect implied by guard/validation/fix patterns once [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective — localize the fix scope; Signals — identify functions and code regions changed in [PATCH_DIFF] (added conditions, preconditions, return-value checks, error paths); FP mitigation — constrain analysis to modified functions/blocks to avoid unrelated matches.
2) Step 2: Objective — infer the missing guard class; Signals — classify added constructs in the patch as null-checks, bounds/length checks, permission/ACL checks, integer overflow checks, lifetime/ownership checks, lock/ordering, or error-prop; FP mitigation — require that the added construct gates a use of the same value/resource immediately after.
3) Step 3: Objective — model the pre-patch unsafe sink; Signals — locate dereferences, array/memory accesses, arithmetic, privileged operations, or API calls that become control-dependent on the newly added guard; FP mitigation — ensure the sink is reachable without the guard in the pre-patch shape.
4) Step 4: Objective — build a guard-to-sink dependency; Signals — show that the added check inspects the same variable/return value/permission that the sink consumes (data or control dependence); FP mitigation — exclude checks that guard different variables or unrelated code paths.
5) Step 5: Objective — identify sources producing the guarded value; Signals — find function parameters, return values from calls, or external inputs that flow into the guarded expression pre-guard; FP mitigation — prefer sources that are unvalidated at entry and not post-dominated by any equivalent check.
6) Step 6: Objective — detect pre-patch occurrences lacking the guard; Signals — in the same function or call pattern, flag uses of the source in the sink without an equivalent guard (same predicate family: null/size/range/permission/overflow/lock held); FP mitigation — require structural similarity (same sink API/operation and same dataflow from source).
7) Step 7: Objective — normalize “equivalent guard” recognition; Signals — consider aliases, wrapper predicates, helper functions providing the same check as the patch-added construct; FP mitigation — whitelist known validators and suppress if present.
8) Step 8: Objective — handle error-propagation fixes; Signals — if the patch adds return-value checks after calls, flag call sites where the return is used without checking for failure/sentinel; FP mitigation — enforce that the API has a documented failure contract (via presence of is-error patterns added in patch).
9) Step 9: Objective — handle concurrency/order fixes; Signals — if the patch adds lock acquisition or ordering, flag accesses to protected state previously performed without the lock or ordering; FP mitigation — require consistent lock association (same mutex/guarded object relation introduced by patch).
10) Step 10: Objective — minimize noise from defensive redundancy; Signals — suppress when an equivalent or stronger check dominates the sink along all paths; FP mitigation — require lack of dominating guard and path feasibility via basic CFG reachability.
11) Step 11: Objective — rank findings by risk; Signals — prioritize sinks involving memory dereference, buffer access, privilege/IO operations, or arithmetic on untrusted sizes/indices; FP mitigation — de-prioritize when operands are compile-time constants or trivially safe ranges.
12) Step 12: Objective — correlate with [PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] when available; Signals — match the inferred guard class to the described root cause to select the final rule (e.g., null-deref vs. bounds vs. auth); FP mitigation — only report when the class matches the patch narrative.

3. Target Elements
- Functions and methods modified in the patch.
- Condition checks (if/require/assert) added by the patch.
- Call sites whose return values become checked in the patch.
- Memory/array accesses, pointer dereferences, arithmetic with sizes/indices.
- Permission/capability checks and gated privileged operations.
- Lock acquisition/release and accesses to guarded state.
- Error handling paths (early returns, goto error, exceptions).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track flow from inputs/parameters/return values into guarded expressions and then into sinks.
- Model control dependence where a newly added condition gates subsequent operations.
- Alias-aware matching between guard operand and sink operand.
- Recognize validator functions as sanitizers introduced or referenced by the patch.
- For concurrency, track association between a lock and the guarded resource across paths.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A function where, pre-patch, a pointer returned from a call is dereferenced without a null check, and the patch adds a null check before dereference — detector should flag the pre-patch pattern.
- Positive: A buffer write using a length derived from input without bounds check, and the patch adds a length/range check — detector should flag the unguarded write.
- Positive: A privileged operation executed without an auth/capability check, and the patch adds such a check — detector should flag the prior unguarded operation.
- Negative: Code where an equivalent guard already dominates the sink through all paths (e.g., earlier size/null/auth check) — detector should not report.
- Negative: Added checks that guard different variables than the sink uses — detector should not report.
- Test harness notes: Run on both pre- and post-patch versions; ensure findings disappear post-patch and appear only at locations made conditional by the patch.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
Medium: Requires diff ingestion, guard normalization, data/control-dependence modeling, and equivalence detection of validators.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Defensive checks present via wrappers or macros not recognized as validators — mitigate by expanding macro and known validator catalogs.
- Infeasible paths due to implicit invariants or contracts — mitigate with basic path feasibility (dominance/post-dominance) and API contract heuristics inferred from patch.
- Benign added checks (hardening) that do not address an exploitable sink — mitigate by requiring a direct guard-to-sink relationship introduced by the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FILE_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided, so the plan cannot specify the concrete vulnerability class for CVE-2024-58237.
- The approach assumes access to a pre- and post-patch diff to infer the guard class and affected sinks.
- It assumes the fix is additive (introducing guards/ordering) rather than refactoring-only; purely semantic fixes without syntactic guard changes may be missed.
