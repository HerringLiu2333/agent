1. Plan Summary
Insufficient vulnerability details were provided; propose a differential-guided, guard-inference detection plan that will flag pre-patch code paths missing the semantic checks/error handling introduced by the patch once [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] are available.

2. Detection Steps
1) Step 1: Objective: Establish what was fixed. Conceptual signals: Extract from [PATCH_DIFF] the types of added changes (e.g., new conditionals, bounds checks, null checks, return-value checks, locking/unlocking, refcount increments/decrements, permission/capability checks, error paths). FP mitigation: None yet—this step collects fix signals.
2) Step 2: Objective: Identify affected APIs and data objects. Conceptual signals: List functions edited in [PATCH_DIFF] and the specific calls, variables, or fields guarded by the new checks. FP mitigation: Restrict to elements appearing in modified hunks.
3) Step 3: Objective: Derive preconditions from the added checks. Conceptual signals: For each added conditional/guard in [PATCH_DIFF], infer the predicate’s role (e.g., value range, nullness, integer overflow prevention, lock state, user input validation). FP mitigation: Only retain predicates that directly gate a dereference, array/memory access, arithmetic operation, privilege-sensitive operation, or resource lifecycle.
4) Step 4: Objective: Locate similar sinks lacking the inferred preconditions. Conceptual signals: Search for the same operations (e.g., deref, memcpy/array index, arithmetic, API invocation, lock use, permission use) on the same or analogous data where no equivalent check precedes them along feasible control paths. FP mitigation: Exempt paths where equivalent checks appear earlier in-dominators or are enforced by callee contracts evidenced by explicit assertions.
5) Step 5: Objective: Track propagation of values to sinks. Conceptual signals: Perform interprocedural flow from sources identified in Step 2 to the guarded sinks, flag paths where the new guard would be required but is absent. FP mitigation: Stop flows when sanitizers equivalent to the added checks are encountered; treat early returns on failure as sanitizers.
6) Step 6: Objective: Confirm error-handling parity. Conceptual signals: From [PATCH_DIFF], capture any added error paths (returning error code, freeing resources, resetting state) and find pre-patch sites that execute the risky operation without such fallback handling. FP mitigation: Ignore sites that already propagate or handle errors consistently (e.g., check-and-return pattern).
7) Step 7: Objective: Model concurrency/resource ordering introduced by the patch. Conceptual signals: If [PATCH_DIFF] adds lock/unlock, refcount ops, or ordering barriers, detect similar critical sections where the same operations occur without the added ordering/locks. FP mitigation: Require that the same shared object or resource type is involved and that the patch’s ordering is semantically relevant (e.g., protects the same field).
8) Step 8: Objective: Prioritize likely exploitable instances. Conceptual signals: Rank findings where the sink is memory access, pointer arithmetic, allocation size computation, privilege checks, or external-facing input processing as derived from [PATCH_DIFF]. FP mitigation: Deprioritize internal-only debug code and paths guarded by compile-time assertions or unreachable conditions.

3. Target Elements
- Functions modified by the patch and their callers.
- Call sites to APIs guarded by newly added checks.
- Condition checks and error-handling branches added by the patch.
- Allocation sites, array/memory accesses, pointer dereferences affected by the patch.
- Lock/unlock and refcount operations added by the patch.
- Function return-value uses (checks introduced by the patch).

4. Dataflow / Taint Considerations
- Track values guarded by the patch’s new checks from their origins to risky sinks.
- Treat the newly added checks as sanitizers/preconditions; pre-patch flows reaching sinks without passing through equivalent checks are suspicious.
- Model interprocedural flows through parameters, returns, and fields relevant to the patched code.
- Consider control-flow dominance: checks must dominate the sink along all feasible paths to count as equivalent.

5. Validation & Test Cases
- Positive: A pre-patch variant of the patched function where the risky operation (e.g., dereference/memcpy/arith/privileged call) occurs without the guard/error handling that the patch adds.
- Negative: A post-patch variant where the guard is present directly before the risky sink, or an equivalent earlier check dominates the sink.
- Test harness notes: Build minimal stubs mirroring the patched function signature and call patterns, then create pairs of before/after snippets to ensure the checker flags only the “before” versions.

6. Estimated Effort & Priority
High: The absence of [PATCH_DIFF]/[PATCH_DESCRIPTION]/[FUNCTION_CONTENT]/[ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] requires building a generic differential-guided framework and later parameterizing it with the concrete fix semantics.

7. Likely False-Positive Sources & Mitigations
- Equivalent checks located in caller or helper functions not recognized: mitigate by interprocedural dominance analysis and recognizing common sanitizers.
- Context-specific invariants (e.g., non-null by construction) not encoded: mitigate by honoring assertions, type annotations, or documented contracts when present.
- Unrelated similar patterns on different resources: mitigate by tying matches to the specific APIs, fields, or variables appearing in the patch.

8. Limitations & Assumptions
- No [PATCH_DESCRIPTION], [PATCH_DIFF], [FUNCTION_CONTENT], or [ROOTCAUSE_ANALYSIS] were provided; the plan cannot name concrete APIs, guards, or sinks.
- Assumes the patch introduces explicit, statically-detectable guards or ordering, which can be used as templates; purely algorithmic fixes without clear guard semantics may not be capturable.
- Assumes availability of both pre- and post-patch code (or at least the post-patch to derive guard patterns).
- The plan remains a template; it must be instantiated with actual changes once the missing sections are supplied.
